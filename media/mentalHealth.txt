Not to brag, but instead of laying in bed ALL day, I laid in bed for MOST of the day, then got up and took a shower. Next up, I conquer the world.
Thank you to the woman who rang me out at Target. You saved my life üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

Things that I didn't realize were anxiety
I finally showered.
RIP Chadwick Boseman
I don‚Äôt want to kill myself, but I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I was run over by a bus. That‚Äôs the stage of depression I‚Äôm in.

Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness
People should get mental health checkups

Well, this is appropriate here.
I did it! I got a job!
I wish family members would STOP saying "Everyone has anxiety, you need to learn to control it." They know I have two anxiety disorders. I tell them countless times to stop. This is why I am MOVING SEVERAL PROVINCES AWAY. They do not respect my boundaries. I can't wait until I move in December.
My psychologist told me to kill myself
Hello everyone I'm glad to inform you that I'm becoming less depressed and I'll be happy again.

My father died
Imagine the privilege that comes with being mentally stable
instead of being put into a mental health ward and restrained for being suicidal, people who are at risk of suicide should be allowed to go to a place where they can eat free ice cream while talking to social workers
Does anybody else with depression struggle with bad emotional lows right after a really good event with someone you really care about comes to an end?
Does anyone else have this running "I hate myself" voice in their head that spontaneously replays over and over?
LPT: If you know someone who startles easily, don't laugh at them when they jump, and DO NOT start startling them on purpose. It could be a trauma response.
True
I‚Äôm not sure where to put this, but I wanted to say something because I‚Äôm proud of myself.
Does anybody else feel like they don't belong anywhere?
I feel bad for my cat because we don‚Äôt have a routine anymore.
Ever stay asleep because dreams are more attractive than reality?
I'm sorry to those who had to say 'I'm just tired' when someone asked if you're okay.
I know most people won‚Äôt care but...

My little sister slid a note under my door telling me she loved me.

I [14F] Survived A School Shooting and Now I Feel Numb
Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?
You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid
Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.
Does anyone else get a high from being with friends or family, and then afterwards crash into depression?
You can sound confident & have anxiety. You can look healthy but feel like shit. You can look happy & be miserable inside. You can be good looking & feel ugly. So be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about
Does anyone grieve the potential they had but lost to mental illness?
We need to stop calling suicide an ‚Äúimpulsive decision‚Äù
150 Days today without self harming!
I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: ‚ÄúAlways do your best‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúwork until you collapse‚Äù. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.
I don't want quarantine to end

My suicidal thoughts and depression.
Movies make personality disorders look quirky and fun. But I'm miserable not knowing who I'm going to be tomorrow.
Has anyone else lost "friends" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?
Sometimes I just want to drive off of the road and wreck my car so people will come to my bedside and tell me they're happy im alive.
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs is your everyday?‚Äù
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shares about dealing with depression: "Make sure you're talking to good people about it. No shame in getting help and wanting to be better."
Does anyone else just have that feeling that they want to go home, when they‚Äôre already home?
Recovering from depression really feels like I‚Äôm trying to stay ‚Äúsober‚Äù
Just spent 15 minutes being berated by a doctor for being on antidepressants, because "they're not good for your brain"
If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.
Did your parent ever say ‚Äústop crying before i give you something to cry about‚Äù?
I like to think, whenever you "pour one out" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.
New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!
I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.
I did it
I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.
I showered today.
I just had sex for the first time since I was raped
To everyone who's birthday was ignored this year:
I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don‚Äôt know what to do
Tired of playing scenarios in my head that don‚Äôt even exist.
Mental health resources are a whole lot of bullshit. Deciding to reach out for help is supposed to be the hard part. Not getting it.
Sometimes we need to laugh at our struggles. I hope you all are feeling well today.
They all want to romanticise mental health issues until they have to deal with the problems that come with it.
Watching all your friends moving on and doing stuff with there life while you're frozen in time and have no motivation to do anything at all>>>>>
Please stop posting your plans to kill yourself, it literally says in the description of this community to do it in r/suicidewatch
I think my life is finally looking up. Im excited for tomorrow for the first time in forever.
57 days sober!
I got connected to the same suicide hotline operator twice
Managed to get out of bed, get dressed, brush my teeth, have a coffee and take my meds. F you depression
To those whose mothers' love wasn't unconditional
I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I‚Äôm a man and I have Tourette‚Äôs. üí¶ü¶Ñüòñ
As i slowly understand my current mental state ive also realized that explaining or asking for help to the wrong people can be extremely dangerous.
Anyone else hate telling anyone how you feel because you feel like a burden
If anybody wants to play some video games and vent. I can play/talk with you.
I hate being told to "relax" while having a panic attack
I got an apology from my old psychiatrist
Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?
Does anyone else have difficulty holding down jobs because of your illness?
The life you are living is for you. Do it for yourself. It isn‚Äôt for anybody else. Live for you, honour you & love you. Never lose eye on that
Does anyone else get heavy criticism while have anxiety attacks? "You're overreacting" "fine, just have it your way then if you're going to make it such a problem" " you're ruining this by blowing it out of proportion" "you're not thinking right, so I'll make decisions for you" or is it just me?
Sick of this double standard.
I made a website for men's mental health.
I went to a protest and rocked this sign!
I want bad things to happen to me just so I can get out of doing things and take a break.
How do I stop creating fake scenarios in my head that upset me?
Dear whoever...
Instead of saying "I'm damaged, I'm broken," say "I'm healing, I'm recovering myself, I'm starting over."
I cleaned my ‚Äúdepression room‚Äù
All trauma is trauma!
2nd day without self harm
Is anyone else starting to feel like life is way to expensive to even try to exist?
Why are mental hospitals so fucked up and why aren't we allowed to talk about it?
Shocked
Does anyone else want to get better, mentally and physically but just doesn‚Äôt have the motivation to do so. Like you know you can improve but you don‚Äôt know if you really want to
Virtual hugs to all of you :)
Whoever comes across this, you're doing fine. Just remember that there's a whole community of people who understand and we're here.
My mental health is the equivalent of a dodgy knee. I'm not going to win any marathons but that doesn't mean i can't do one (and finish it in my own time)
First post. I‚Äôve struggled with depression for over 12 years and I rarely put actual emotion, and pain into my art. Last week I completed my first attempt at expressing how I feel waking up lately, struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. Here it is: ‚ÄúThe Hand I Was Dealt‚Äù
I've been struggling with my mental health for years and I've finally been brave enough to make an appointment with a doctor.
6 months clean from self harm!
Maybe the last time I hugged my son.
Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I‚Äôm sad. Words aren‚Äôt always necessary.
Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.
For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.
It‚Äôs been 69 days since I last self-harmed.

I don't wanna die, just don't want to keep living.

Finally cleaned my room and did laundry after 3 weeks
I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful
Isn‚Äôt this the truth!
If you have the power to make someone smile, do it. The world needs more of that.
The popular saying to ‚Äúfollow your heart/instincts/inner voice‚Äù is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I‚Äôm learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.
Does anyone else get uncomfortable when people do nice things for you because you hate yourself?
My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom & help me honor her.
Even if it doesn't go away, you can get better at dealing with it
Did any of you ever feel guilty about not doing any (school) work but felt so tired of it you couldn‚Äôt even think about getting started?
Abuse [trigger warning]
We had a protest in NYC called "I'M MENTALLY ILL, AND I DON'T KILL."
This is a battle I‚Äôm going to fight until the end. If I die, I‚Äôm going to die on my feet. My memory and appetite might be quickly declining, (as evidenced by neuropsychological tests). But I‚Äôm not going to die quietly.
Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?
I've started talking to myself the way I talk to friends
Can we please let men open up without derailing?
Does anyone else feel like they just don't have an identity since you spend so much time coping with your illness?
Guilting people out of suicide by telling us to think of our families isn‚Äôt the answer!

I feel really unwell because how badly my country is being destroyed by russia
the other day i got a calendar notification on my phone. it said "die"
My depression is not an "aesthetic". It's not cute to be a "sad boy/sad girl".
Does anyone feel dramatic/like a giant burden after they start talking about their emotions?
Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?
I've been sober for 125 days now!
I wanna go home, but I‚Äôm already home.
Thinking about starting a subbreddit and or a Facebook group called "MENtality". A place where men can freely talk about their problems, to reach out to each other and help each other.
Everyone who's feeling down today, FEEL HUGGED. Let's wallow in our pain together (ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)„Å§‚äÇ(ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)

The saying that mental health disorders are ‚Äúinvisible illnesses‚Äù is the biggest joke I‚Äôve ever heard.

Just want to give a shoutout to the person I love, who finally today, after 32 years, admitted that he needs to go to therapy
My boyfriend just killed himself
I stop replying to people for no reason
Do yoy guys feel like you don't deserve to be with your boyfriend/girlfriend because you feel like a messed up person and don't deserve happiness?
Anyone else just know they will eventually k*ll themselves.
Why people can't understand that sometimes there is no reason?
I Made FREE Mental Health Printables! (Planners, Self-Care Tips, etc.)
I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I‚Äôve faced, I‚Äôm happy I can finally leave.
Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else
You made it.
Online school is horrible
you ever push everyone you used to cherish out of your life because you overthink what that thing they said means when it really doesn't mean that and your anxiety creates false narratives of situations resulting in self destruction?
I nearly killed myself today but I‚Äôm still here
Does any one else get suspicious when life is going well and you‚Äôre happy?
Does anybody ever feel numb for a long time and one day you get a slight rush of happiness and it makes you very emotional?
Does anyone feel like you want to hide and be alone for a few days after social interactions?
Treating someone terribly and telling them to go to therapy is kinda like punching someone in the face and telling them to see a doctor

I feel like a burden to my friends when I ask them to talk about my mental health
People LOVE to love mental illnesses when it‚Äôs the broken sadness hopeless depression type but won‚Äôt hesitate to send us to jail or get us assassinated for a single slip of the angry uncontrollable emotions type
Depression is not just sadness
RIP üíî
Today I realised that the negative voices and the constant doubts going round in my head, the bad feelings ect ect aren't me, they're an illness invading my mental space.
Changing the way you speak helps to change your perspective.
Is anyone else struggling to hang on right now?
If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.
Who can relate?
Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.
Threw out a self harm tool.
sitting on my bed with my blanket over my head and body while playing animal crossing has become my new way of coping

can a kid have mental health issues?
My dad told me I‚Äôm getting ‚Äòfatter‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt finished eating. Weighed myself (no weight movement). Went to the toilet and forced vomit. I just don‚Äôt want to eat anymore. They know I‚Äôm bulimic for almost a decade. Work from home is affecting my mental health and hearing those words made it worse.
Give yourself the same love and affection you give to other people and watch yourself blossom to something special
I wish that therapy wasn‚Äôt so outrageously expensive in the US.
Life gets a whole lot better when you stop waiting for other people to love you and start loving yourself
If you were given the chance of not have ever been born, would you say yes?
Did anyone feel worse after admitting you're not ok?
I feel bad that many posts in this group don't get many replies. lets try reply to two other posts for every post we put!
Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?
Today you have done enough by being
Going from extremely horny to feeling numb to being sad to feeling nervous and anxious to being on the verge of crying and having a mental breakdown to feeling sad and being unmotivated to feeling extremely angry is completely exhausting
Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?

I put blankets over my head when I'm sad and pretend I'm a turtle.
Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?
1 year clean!!
Is it normal to talk to yourself?
Mental health has no direct ‚Äúcure‚Äù and a lot of the times I think we have to figure it out on our own. Society doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand our struggle and we have to try and show them why mental health care is important.
I know it's weird to celebrate but yesterday was the most "normal" day I've had in 3 years
Just about sums it up
Taking vitamin D pills cured my depression
I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC

To the teenagers behind me at the store
Small accomplished but Showered and brushed my teeth for the first time in a week
It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.
Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?
This mirror constantly made me feel like shit. Olanzapine and effexor has ruined my skin and I've put on a decent amount of weight. I hate what was looking back at me. So I did the only thing I can do well. Painted the mirror. I hate it less now.
Let's love ourselves as well as each other. (x-post blackpeopletwitter)

Some psychologists say "it doesn't matter if parents tried their best, what matters is that the child never felt that it was enough".
If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering

Well, I finally did it. I told my mom I want to start therapy.
What do you think life is like for people who don‚Äôt struggle with mental illness at all?
We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.
Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?
Friendly reminder: just because you feel fine on your meds, doesn't mean you'll feel the same without them.

[TW] I survived my suicide attempt on Thursday.
I unsubbed from every sub and YouTube channel I perceived as being based on negativity, including all political subs.
I feel so unproductive and cannot motivate myself to be productive
Spending Christmas alone in bed with beer and joints, feels amazing not having the pressures of my shitty family around. Fuck them if they're not a positive part of your life.
I really hate hearing "It gets better"
Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out

People don't realise how lucky they are to have good mental health
Let‚Äôs all discuss toxic positivity
Social media (mostly tiktok) not only romanticizes, but also encourages self harm to young people.

It was my birthday yesterday and now I realise how unimportant I am to everyone
Why do people hate quiet/shy people?
I wanted to say a massive ‚ÄúTHANK YOU‚Äù for all the support you gave me when I lost my mind a few days ago. You immediately responded to my panicky post with great advice. I accidentally took twice my lithium dose and forgot everything. Your help calm me and my mum and got us through it
people only care about mental illnesses that are cute, quiet, and make it easy to pity you. do you agree?
For the first time in 20 years...
