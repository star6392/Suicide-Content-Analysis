You see, well, I've been in this box for quite some time now, it feels as if the box is on the outside of my head, like [so](http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/03/83/b4/cb/08/ball_in_box_preview_featured.jpg), and I'm stuck in the remaining space, unable to get either in or out. 

Now, this was bearable for some time, but I've been getting awfully dissociated and I'm having trouble keeping track of reality. 

I posted here once before but no one responded so I thought I never posted it and now that post is gone so I either deleted it or I never clicked ""post"" in the first place. 

See, well, my mind does this thing. When I am in the middle of the action, it imagines all possible outcomes. In high detail. It has been doing that for as long as I can remember. I watch those things like mini films. And I remember them, but not which of these things happened, if it wasn't overly important. 

I tend to make myself upset or angry over things because a strong emotional reaction triggers my memory. 

But then, there's the fact that I've gotten paranoid because I'm scared of the ""what is real, what is not"" thing. I can't keep track because my mind does the detailed possibilities for every little thing that happens, every step I take, and as seconds pass, it imagines more things and remember less. I can honestly say that during writing this, I have forgotten I was doing it a few times. 

It's starting to interrupt me in... Everything I do. I used to be able to function on a somewhat strict schedule but I have no one to monitor me anymore so I opt to do nothing for my own safety. I am scared of losing track of time again. My paranoia also goes toward making me think there is someone watching. It is comforting sometimes, but sometimes it feels like I am in a Shutter Island situation and I've actually been sitting in a white box all this time, imagining everything that I thought has been happening.

So, yes, I know, I need psychotherapy, I might have a serious problem right here, and I have actually decided to check myself into a psych ward for a longer period of time fairly soon. However, the fairly soon won't be for another month or even more and I need some help in the meantime. 

What can I do to remind myself if things that have been happening are real? Can I be sure I am not having hallucinations? Am I having hallucinations? Do people really stare at other people? I don't know what to ask, really. Can someone just give me their opinion on this? 

Also, if I tell this to my psychiatrist in similar word, what will he think? I haven't talked to my previous therapists since June because I was feeling okay, but then things got much worse and I'd like to go back to the same people because I'm relatively comfortable talking to them, yeah. 

I've tried to make this somewhat clear and I know this is strange but can you please help me stay sane for another month? I'm anxious a lot and I don't get out of the room anymore and now the room has started making me anxious too.  

Thank you so much.


EDIT: Oh. I forgot. I've been diagnosed with severe long-lasting depression and they had suspicions of a personality disorder, but that remains unclear for now, which is why I need to go back. 

EDIT 2: Thank you very much, everyone who responded. It makes me feel a bit weird to come back here and read it now but I am very grateful for all the support, I really needed to say some things.

Forgive me if I tell this non linearly, there's so much for me to ask that settling on a starting, mid and end point is impossible. So allow me to just type.

My sister thinks she's perfect. Well, that's one of her delusions. It's so easy for her to believe anything she or somebody she trusts (read: somebody who has the same opinions as her) says that she's living in a fantasy world devoid of empathy or any constructive behavior whatsoever. I bring up the perfection because it's been the hardest blocker in attempting to help her. By attempting I of course mean to say nothing has worked. We've taken her to all kinds of therapists from every fee bracket but she refuses to accept help from any of them. The only ones she doesn't vehemently refuse to listen to are the ones who pat her on the back and reinforce her delusions. Now she's lashing out at the boarding school that everyone in the family is working full time jobs to afford for her. If and when she's expelled/drops herself out/we aren't able to pay the tuition any more (my main worry now that the mine that my dad works for has suddenly shut down) she'll have nowhere to go. She can't come back home because she framed my dad for molesting her, nobody else in my immediate or extended family can afford to take her in, and she's made only one useless connection (she made a friend) the entire time she's been there. She's burned every other possible bridge and puts the torch to each one we try to build for her. She's only sixteen years old and I know for a fact she can't take care of herself. My mom is under intense stress and my dad has taken up alcoholism. She doesn't care about any of this and thinks we're being bigoted. 

What i think I'm trying to ask here is what the hell to do and what my sister's problem even is. My dad is becoming suicidal and my mom is depressed.

December 30th, 2013 changed my life irreversibly, and left me devastated. I am uncertain that I have a firm grasp on reality anymore. My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiance passed away rather unexpectedly, from complications involving medication for long-term bi polar disorder and alcohol. Her family has confirmed that her death was determined to be accidental, but somewhere in my mind I have this horrible mocking voice insisting that she committed suicide. 

I could not begin to reason as to why I think this. We discussed the probability of getting engaged June or July of this year, she specifically told me her ring size, and what type of ceremony she would prefer (non-religious for those who may ask). She told me that our relationship was beautiful, and that she felt like she had meaning when we were together, that she was fulfilled. She gave the strong impression that she really wanted a future with me, even in times of mania and depression. We scheduled a therapy session that we would have attended together to address her mental illness and how she would function in a committed relationship. She went so far as to show me that she was taking her medication and putting in the effort to ""function"" with me. 

Her mother and father both passed away more than a decade ago, and her sister was involved in her life, but was consumed with her career. I was the last person to physically see her, and the last person to speak with her via phone or text. Both occasions, we parted with loving exchanges and confirmation of plans for the day after the 30th. I am dismantling myself up, looking for a sign that I missed, something that I should have noticed or picked up on. The grief has been awful, and I am not sure if I am treading water, or simply regressing. Her ring still sits on my desk, with the travel tickets for my proposal plans. I have not been able to wash the clothing I was wearing when I last saw her, as they still smell like her and her perfume. Thus far, I have been unable to move anything that reminds me of her, and most days I can barely stand to look at said objects. I find myself talking to her quite often when I am alone (which I am most days since I essentially live alone having completely opposite schedules with my roommate) and sometimes in public places. These conversations are beyond a musing or a simple I love you/miss you/ etc. They progress into full-blown reports of my day, what I will be doing that evening, and even my weekend plans. I ask her questions and make suggestions about what we could have or would have done. In most instances, I pause during the conversation as if I am expecting a response, and I do not think that this is a normal or healthy part of the grieving process. This odd behavior was brought to my attention by several friends, coworkers, and my parents.

Over the past month I have been seeking counseling and therapy, but I feel that I am not progressing in a reasonable manner. I cannot afford anything beyond outreach centers and public services as I am not yet eligible for health insurance through my employer (though I will be within the month). I feel that as a result, I may be heading down a path that is not healthy for me, physically or mentally. I realize I am self-medicating with alcohol and cigarettes, and I am making little attempt to correct the destructive behavior. I have had days where I cannot get out of bed, cannot think in a logical, decisive manner, and I have had days where I have casually contemplated suicide. My performance at work is suffering, and my social life has all but splintered. I am basically at my wits end trying to decide if I should go broke seeing a psychologist, or if this is actually understandable behavior that can be overcome without professional help.

So, to ask an actual question; do I sound like I am succumbing to some sort of depression or PTSD, and does this come off as a serious concern, or should I hold out until I get insurance?

To start with, I'm a 17 year old female with nothing really to cause what's going on. So, let's assume it's something genetic. My sister, who we share a father with but not a mother, has bipolar mood disorder. Me on the other hand, I have no clue.

As of lately, all my relationships are failing. Everything started to get terrible as of a year ago. I was finally in a perfect relationship, which I have been in how for a little over two years. The first few months, perfect, then it began to fall apart and got fixed somehow. Anyway, after that year I began to change. I began to hate him, alienate myself from everyone I knew, and started resenting myself. I had to explain this to my boyfriend, which he didn't understand what's going on in my head. I'll explain the best I can at this point.

Everyday it has gotten worse and worse. I never have any real emotion, it's just like a plain of numbness until something triggers. I proceed to go through a handful of emotions, normally extreme, like extreme anger, extreme happiness, extreme sadness, etc. This happens over a course of a few seconds. I can go from sobbing hysterically, to perfectly fine in 10 seconds flat. This is what began to tear apart my relationship with my boyfriend. I would get angry at nothing or things that were just normal. It's put me off at clingy. I react to the same situation differently every single time. I will make something out of nothing, constantly bring up the past, but I don't think highly of myself because I realize I'm an idiot for some of the things I say and apologize for hours and beg for forgiveness... but I can't hold back the anger I have for no apparent reason, or I can't hold back the insane amount of sadness I feel.

I explained it as slot machines. Someone sits down and keeps cranking on the handle, the handle being my brain. The spinning of the pictures is how my brain feels, it quickly jolts through all the emotions as quickly as that. When it stops, it's like you can NEVER win. So the player keeps cranking the handle over and over again getting more and more frustrated. The more I go through these emotions, I become exhausted and can't deal with things hardly anymore. I just want to curl up and cry or get really angry at everything. I'm just at a complete loss.

A friend of mine who has Borderline Personality Disorder suggested that I might have BPD. I show a lot of the signs, I show a lot of the signs in a relationship. I did a lot of research and to me that's what it seems it is. I told my boyfriend, asked opinion, he agreed, and seems to have just... started treating me differently and claims I ""picked"" him as a victim. I never came into the relationship with the intent of hurting him. I had no clue I had a problem until recently I was searching through a thread on Reddit and saw someone who was going through what I was (as far as mentality), and someone had mentioned BPD.

I used to struggle horribly with self-injury, and sometimes my brain still thinks about it. Sometimes I wonder about suicide, but never in the way of serious. Just curious. Sometimes I get overly angry and want to cut everyone out of my life. Sometimes I just want to be alone in my own little world without anyone. Sometimes I just want to cry and cry and cry. I've lost all grip on being able to control emotions.

I realize I have a problem, but it's beginning to get too late for me to save my relationship, and I feel like losing it would only make me even worse. I've lost all my friends due to me being an introvert and never having the energy to go out with them, plus switching to homeschooling because of the sheer amount/extent of the bullying I was receiving daily in school. I know that I need to get help. I've asked my mother countless times to called the mental health clinic I gave her a number for so I could get an appointment, since I can't do it myself (or so I've been told). She just says ""oh you're just being female"" or ""oh I forgot"". She believes my behavior is normal. I don't believe it to be.

Again, sorry for the huge wall of text. I just need outside thoughts, outside people to talk to who are complete strangers. I pushed myself really hard to make a post because I'm so afraid of what people think of me.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I don't know where to start...

I deal with mild to moderate depression, strong social anxiety and some general anxiety, mild tourette's (meaning my tics are on and off and can go into ""remission"" if you will; however, when a tic comes on it can last anywhere from a couple days to a month or 2, and affect me for nearly 100% of the time I'm awake.) My most common tics are sniffling, moving my nose around, grunting, throat clearing, doing weird flexing with my throat or abdomen, wiggling ears etc. 

I've sometimes wondered if I also deal with some OCD. I don't need everything I see to be all neat and tidy, and I don't constantly fear bacteria or anything; however, I would still call myself a germaphobe, and I feel like I have very obsessive thoughts.

Another thing I thought I'd add is that when I was in elementary school I was put in a class for kids who were slow, and my parents were advised to have me checked for ADD, but my parents, especially my Mom, are against those kinds of diagnoses and think it sets kids up for failure, not to mention they feel like ADD is a made up disorder and that being a space cadet or hyperactive etc. for a little boy is 100% normal. anyways, as you can imagine, i was never tested. once i moved on to middle school, i was no longer in any special learning class though.

something else i've noticed about myself, though it could be totally normal, i've wondered if it's not. although i'm a 23 year old male, and for the most part appear to act my age, I still feel very much like a child on the inside, and on top of that I haven't even remotely lost my childhood imagination.

another thing worth mentioning is that I seem to have developed a mild  speech impediment. i noticed this around the age of 20. it's become a lot more common that i stutter, slur or mispronounce words. it's not all the time, but it's something that's happened enough in my 20s for me to notice it's not normal and a new thing for me. 

so... do you think i'm just dealing with mild-moderate cases of numerous mental illnesses, or do all these things fall under a specific illness?

disclaimer: I'm not a hypochondriac. i know what a true hypochondriac is and personally know a few, and that doesn't describe me at all. although i deal with anxiety, i find i am quite rational at times where i'm not anxious; however, true hypochondriac can bring on anxiety just from being irrational, instead of simply becoming anxious which can cause irrational thinking.

anyways, i hope someone can give me some sort of answers. thanks",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Am I dealing with a specific mental illness with many symptoms, or just numerous mental illnesses?"

Like, normally I'm at a pretty even baseline, but it was like that normal baseline was coated in some sort of gritty, oily film... Like used diesel oil.  My parents (mom and grandma) both decided to dig into me about a short term business venture that I've decided to invest some of my assets in because my normal job is giving me shit for money in the next two weeks.  When I asked them how they proposed I make enough money to pay my bills this month they just said ""have you applied for any jobs?"", which is entirely counterproductive to what I'm trying to accomplish with my life and they both know it.

So I've ended up in this spiral of depression, anxiety, and anger, and I know it's bad but I just don't know how to stop it, nor do I know how I'm supposed to make it financially to next month ""the right way"" as my mom put it.  When I finally decided to go in my room last night I felt fucking terrible; like a complete failure.  I couldn't sleep so I plugged in my wireless headphones and started listening to music, but a short while later the charge on the batteries ran out and I almost started crying because I didn't feel like I could handle being so alone.

This isn't the first time this has happened, it's just the most recent and aggravating time.  I asked my grandma about it (who studied psychology and worked in the field for 25 years) and she said that it's like this for everyone; if they're happy for a few days they deplete their reserves of feel-good chemicals and whatnot and then they're down for a few days.  But this doesn't feel 'normal'.  It feels like a rollercoaster, and I want off.

Sorry for the wall of text, I left out as much as I could while keeping the story coherent.

**TL;DR:** My mood keeps swinging between Mount Everest and the Marianas Trench.  Doesn't feel normal even though my grandma says it is.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Lots of up's and down's, some more severe than others... Kinda confused as to what's going on."

In general, I find amphetamine to be much 'gentler' in terms of drug-dependency, requiring less frequent dosing and less monitoring. Treatment with methylphenidate in particular can be pretty harsh, because however powerful your desire and intention to be productive (i.e. not be depressed), it is a drug that gives and takes from you that ability with every dose and every re-dose. But the supposition that methylphenidate is a 'mild' stimulant and that amphetamine is a 'more powerful' stimulant, does not seem to be significant in regards to either of the drugs' effects on depression, although I have yet to experiment with higher doses of amphetamine (and honestly, I am not very enthusiastic about doing experiments at the expense of the treatment for my depression). I suspect that the metric of stimulant-power is based on a paradigm of drugs that are abused for stimulation at maximal non-toxic doses, so it is not surprising if it is unrelated to the use of the same drugs for depression at minimal effective doses.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Stimulants for depression: Ritalin compared to Speed

I haven't really done a lot of research on everything, so forgive me if I use some non-educated terminology to describe things. I will start off by saying that I have not seen any professional on this and don't really plan on it, I just want to know if there are any real disorders. I will now do my best to list the things wrong with me.

* highly paranoid

* very terrible sleeping patterns (I go to sleep at 1am every night, wake up at  4:45am, go about the day ready to collapse, then cannot go to sleep the following night until 1am again even though I'm super tired)

* I know there's a fancy term for it somewhere, but I do not know it. I always feel like there's some kind of big conspiracy going on. Always someone surveilling me, watching me, judging me.

* I overthink the consequences of things a lot.

* I always feel like people will judge me (not related to the above). Like, I'm really reclusive on sharing anything with new people or family members, even if it's as small as musical tastes. I always minimize windows when people walk into my room when I'm talking to someone online, even if we're saying things like ""Hello"" and ""What's up?"".

* Bipolar, though not very bad

* I am very reluctant to make any effort to form relationships. No matter how much I want it, something in my mind pushes me away from trying.

* Constant abstract thoughts and actions

* Very small, insignificant, infrequent auditory hallucinations (probably just normal)

* Rage that comes out of nowhere from even small things like someone moving an item around in my room. Rage that is very strong and really makes me just want to yell.

* Slightly introvert. I looked into this just now and aw that it involves hating small talk and loving to talk about things that interest you. Small talk bores the living hell out of me and there is nothing that bothers me more when making contact with people (which I rarely do anyway).

* Another that really bothers me. I think things in my mind that are really vivid (things I say or do) and sometimes, I have trouble remembering if I actually did that or said it. Like, I'll think of just standing up and yelling in the middle of a room, or be having a fake conversation in my head then, once it's over, think back and question myself with ""Did I just do that, or imagine it?"". These things seem so realistic, I feel that one day I will actually enact one of these by accident and not even realize it.

That's about all I can think of at the moment. The things that bothers me most are the paranoia and sleeping problems. I also have one more problem, but it's not anything I felt needed immediate attention (though it irritates the hell out of me). I have a ""shy bladder"". Basically, I cannot urinate in a public restroom while people are around and take ~10 seconds to get started going even when no people are there. In my own home even, I have problems getting anything out when I hear people near the door. I would love to know how to fix this last one, though I won't emphasize it as much as all of the above symptoms.

**Just a background**: I'm 20, male, and living alone. I have a good circle of friends and am active with some activities. Everything's pretty average here. 

Anyway, for the past few years I've been feeling incredibly lonely. This is weird, since I've got a couple of close friends (around 3, not a lot, but they're there) to hang out with. I don't get to spend time with them everyday, maybe only once a month because of busy schedules. When I've got time from school, I spend some moments walking around in parks, greeting people, participating in activities to engage in small talk. I really just do this so I could keep myself sane. 

P.S. And no, it doesn't feel like I want to have a girlfriend really bad. That would be nice, but it's not the reason why I feel this way. 

------------------------

How it feels like is this: whenever I go back to my room, wake up in the morning, or walk around the city, there's this overwhelming sensation of being lonely. It's not the sad kind of loneliness that makes me tear up, it's the kind of loneliness where I feel like someone dumped me inside a white, windowless room and left me there for a day. It is driving me insane. This wouldn't have bothered me so much (I really could've carried that burdened) except when this year the chest pains started happening. 

Every morning, my heart is incredibly heavy like I've been heartbroken for a long time, except I'm not actually even in any relationship. One particular moment I remember was when I felt like I even had a stroke. It was a scary experience, but it hurt that bad. It feels like I have a lump on my throat sometimes. Most days, I feel uneasy, restless, and unable to concentrate with daily activities. Although one thing I could say is I'm probably not depressed? I don't feel super sad, maybe just a bit all day, but not to the point I want to end my life. I just feel jittery all day because I feel like going insane. 

Anyway, I guess that's the gist of it. I pretty much wanted to ask if it was normal to feel this way? Should I be concerned that the chest pains have been happening for over a year now? What should I do about it?

&gt; **Depression is an illness, and illnesses require treatment.** The World Health Organization releases statistics related to disease burden, aka DALYs. The final report organizes diseases and injuries in a list according to which ones result in the highest numbers of deaths, as well as which ones are the heaviest burdens in terms of recovery time, required treatment, etc. Guess what? **Unipolar depressive disorders*** (like Major Depressive Disorder, aka depression) **are ranked the 10th most debilitating diseases in the entire world as of the year 2011**. In Europe, it’s ranked the third most debilitating disease, and in the Americas, it’s the second most debilitating disease. In the world, depression ranks higher than diabetes, malaria, tuberculosis, certain types of cancer (trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer, to be exact), and cirrhosis, while in the Americas and Europe, depression ranks higher than road injury, stroke, Alzheimer’s, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, colon and rectum cancers, breast cancer, congenital anomalies, and hypertensive heart disease.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m not trying to say that having depression somehow makes you “sicker” or “more worthy” than people with other diseases - come on, sick is sick. Instead, I’m trying to get people to realize that depression is a serious and debilitating illness, and people who suffer from depression deserve to receive treatment and support. If a medication is not working for you (eg: it makes you feel “foggy,” you’re always tired, you can’t sleep, etc), talk to your doctor - there ARE other medications to try, and it can take anywhere from months to years to find the right combination of treatments for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **tl;dr**: Depression is an illness that affects millions of people from all walks of life across the world and is considered the 10th most debilitating disease in the world. If you or someone you know has a mood disorder,* treat is like the serious illness it is.

&gt; *The statistics reported by the WHO confirm that a number of mental and behavioural disorders are very debilitating - these include unipolar depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood behavioural disorders, idiopathic intellectual disability, and other mental and behavioural disorders. More information about any of these disorders can be found at www.who.int or elsewhere online. The best resource is always a certified doctor.

I wrote this in response to an image I came across on Tumblr that suggested an anti-drug attitude concerning depression treatment. Obviously, I'm not a professional by *any* stretch of the imagination, but I'm really proud of myself for writing the post - I've been suffering with major depression for more than two years now, and writing (especially any sort of academic writing) is often very difficult for me. I feel like this is a step in the right direction :)

You see, well, I've been in this box for quite some time now, it feels as if the box is on the outside of my head, like [so](http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/03/83/b4/cb/08/ball_in_box_preview_featured.jpg), and I'm stuck in the remaining space, unable to get either in or out. 

Now, this was bearable for some time, but I've been getting awfully dissociated and I'm having trouble keeping track of reality. 

I posted here once before but no one responded so I thought I never posted it and now that post is gone so I either deleted it or I never clicked ""post"" in the first place. 

See, well, my mind does this thing. When I am in the middle of the action, it imagines all possible outcomes. In high detail. It has been doing that for as long as I can remember. I watch those things like mini films. And I remember them, but not which of these things happened, if it wasn't overly important. 

I tend to make myself upset or angry over things because a strong emotional reaction triggers my memory. 

But then, there's the fact that I've gotten paranoid because I'm scared of the ""what is real, what is not"" thing. I can't keep track because my mind does the detailed possibilities for every little thing that happens, every step I take, and as seconds pass, it imagines more things and remember less. I can honestly say that during writing this, I have forgotten I was doing it a few times. 

It's starting to interrupt me in... Everything I do. I used to be able to function on a somewhat strict schedule but I have no one to monitor me anymore so I opt to do nothing for my own safety. I am scared of losing track of time again. My paranoia also goes toward making me think there is someone watching. It is comforting sometimes, but sometimes it feels like I am in a Shutter Island situation and I've actually been sitting in a white box all this time, imagining everything that I thought has been happening.

So, yes, I know, I need psychotherapy, I might have a serious problem right here, and I have actually decided to check myself into a psych ward for a longer period of time fairly soon. However, the fairly soon won't be for another month or even more and I need some help in the meantime. 

What can I do to remind myself if things that have been happening are real? Can I be sure I am not having hallucinations? Am I having hallucinations? Do people really stare at other people? I don't know what to ask, really. Can someone just give me their opinion on this? 

Also, if I tell this to my psychiatrist in similar word, what will he think? I haven't talked to my previous therapists since June because I was feeling okay, but then things got much worse and I'd like to go back to the same people because I'm relatively comfortable talking to them, yeah. 

I've tried to make this somewhat clear and I know this is strange but can you please help me stay sane for another month? I'm anxious a lot and I don't get out of the room anymore and now the room has started making me anxious too.  

Thank you so much.


EDIT: Oh. I forgot. I've been diagnosed with severe long-lasting depression and they had suspicions of a personality disorder, but that remains unclear for now, which is why I need to go back. 

EDIT 2: Thank you very much, everyone who responded. It makes me feel a bit weird to come back here and read it now but I am very grateful for all the support, I really needed to say some things.

Forgive me if I tell this non linearly, there's so much for me to ask that settling on a starting, mid and end point is impossible. So allow me to just type.

My sister thinks she's perfect. Well, that's one of her delusions. It's so easy for her to believe anything she or somebody she trusts (read: somebody who has the same opinions as her) says that she's living in a fantasy world devoid of empathy or any constructive behavior whatsoever. I bring up the perfection because it's been the hardest blocker in attempting to help her. By attempting I of course mean to say nothing has worked. We've taken her to all kinds of therapists from every fee bracket but she refuses to accept help from any of them. The only ones she doesn't vehemently refuse to listen to are the ones who pat her on the back and reinforce her delusions. Now she's lashing out at the boarding school that everyone in the family is working full time jobs to afford for her. If and when she's expelled/drops herself out/we aren't able to pay the tuition any more (my main worry now that the mine that my dad works for has suddenly shut down) she'll have nowhere to go. She can't come back home because she framed my dad for molesting her, nobody else in my immediate or extended family can afford to take her in, and she's made only one useless connection (she made a friend) the entire time she's been there. She's burned every other possible bridge and puts the torch to each one we try to build for her. She's only sixteen years old and I know for a fact she can't take care of herself. My mom is under intense stress and my dad has taken up alcoholism. She doesn't care about any of this and thinks we're being bigoted.

December 30th, 2013 changed my life irreversibly, and left me devastated. I am uncertain that I have a firm grasp on reality anymore. My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiance passed away rather unexpectedly, from complications involving medication for long-term bi polar disorder and alcohol. Her family has confirmed that her death was determined to be accidental, but somewhere in my mind I have this horrible mocking voice insisting that she committed suicide. 

I could not begin to reason as to why I think this. We discussed the probability of getting engaged June or July of this year, she specifically told me her ring size, and what type of ceremony she would prefer (non-religious for those who may ask). She told me that our relationship was beautiful, and that she felt like she had meaning when we were together, that she was fulfilled. She gave the strong impression that she really wanted a future with me, even in times of mania and depression. We scheduled a therapy session that we would have attended together to address her mental illness and how she would function in a committed relationship. She went so far as to show me that she was taking her medication and putting in the effort to ""function"" with me. 

Her mother and father both passed away more than a decade ago, and her sister was involved in her life, but was consumed with her career. I was the last person to physically see her, and the last person to speak with her via phone or text. Both occasions, we parted with loving exchanges and confirmation of plans for the day after the 30th. I am dismantling myself up, looking for a sign that I missed, something that I should have noticed or picked up on. The grief has been awful, and I am not sure if I am treading water, or simply regressing. Her ring still sits on my desk, with the travel tickets for my proposal plans. I have not been able to wash the clothing I was wearing when I last saw her, as they still smell like her and her perfume. Thus far, I have been unable to move anything that reminds me of her, and most days I can barely stand to look at said objects. I find myself talking to her quite often when I am alone (which I am most days since I essentially live alone having completely opposite schedules with my roommate) and sometimes in public places. These conversations are beyond a musing or a simple I love you/miss you/ etc. They progress into full-blown reports of my day, what I will be doing that evening, and even my weekend plans. I ask her questions and make suggestions about what we could have or would have done. In most instances, I pause during the conversation as if I am expecting a response, and I do not think that this is a normal or healthy part of the grieving process. This odd behavior was brought to my attention by several friends, coworkers, and my parents.

Over the past month I have been seeking counseling and therapy, but I feel that I am not progressing in a reasonable manner. I cannot afford anything beyond outreach centers and public services as I am not yet eligible for health insurance through my employer (though I will be within the month). I feel that as a result, I may be heading down a path that is not healthy for me, physically or mentally. I realize I am self-medicating with alcohol and cigarettes, and I am making little attempt to correct the destructive behavior. I have had days where I cannot get out of bed, cannot think in a logical, decisive manner, and I have had days where I have casually contemplated suicide. My performance at work is suffering, and my social life has all but splintered. I am basically at my wits end trying to decide if I should go broke seeing a psychologist, or if this is actually understandable behavior that can be overcome without professional help.

So, to ask an actual question; do I sound like I am succumbing to some sort of depression or PTSD, and does this come off as a serious concern, or should I hold out until I get insurance?

To start with, I'm a 17 year old female with nothing really to cause what's going on. So, let's assume it's something genetic. My sister, who we share a father with but not a mother, has bipolar mood disorder. Me on the other hand, I have no clue.

As of lately, all my relationships are failing. Everything started to get terrible as of a year ago. I was finally in a perfect relationship, which I have been in how for a little over two years. The first few months, perfect, then it began to fall apart and got fixed somehow. Anyway, after that year I began to change. I began to hate him, alienate myself from everyone I knew, and started resenting myself. I had to explain this to my boyfriend, which he didn't understand what's going on in my head. I'll explain the best I can at this point.

Everyday it has gotten worse and worse. I never have any real emotion, it's just like a plain of numbness until something triggers. I proceed to go through a handful of emotions, normally extreme, like extreme anger, extreme happiness, extreme sadness, etc. This happens over a course of a few seconds. I can go from sobbing hysterically, to perfectly fine in 10 seconds flat. This is what began to tear apart my relationship with my boyfriend. I would get angry at nothing or things that were just normal. It's put me off at clingy. I react to the same situation differently every single time. I will make something out of nothing, constantly bring up the past, but I don't think highly of myself because I realize I'm an idiot for some of the things I say and apologize for hours and beg for forgiveness... but I can't hold back the anger I have for no apparent reason, or I can't hold back the insane amount of sadness I feel.

I explained it as slot machines. Someone sits down and keeps cranking on the handle, the handle being my brain. The spinning of the pictures is how my brain feels, it quickly jolts through all the emotions as quickly as that. When it stops, it's like you can NEVER win. So the player keeps cranking the handle over and over again getting more and more frustrated. The more I go through these emotions, I become exhausted and can't deal with things hardly anymore. I just want to curl up and cry or get really angry at everything. I'm just at a complete loss.

A friend of mine who has Borderline Personality Disorder suggested that I might have BPD. I show a lot of the signs, I show a lot of the signs in a relationship. I did a lot of research and to me that's what it seems it is. I told my boyfriend, asked opinion, he agreed, and seems to have just... started treating me differently and claims I ""picked"" him as a victim. I never came into the relationship with the intent of hurting him. I had no clue I had a problem until recently I was searching through a thread on Reddit and saw someone who was going through what I was (as far as mentality), and someone had mentioned BPD.

I used to struggle horribly with self-injury, and sometimes my brain still thinks about it. Sometimes I wonder about suicide, but never in the way of serious. Just curious. Sometimes I get overly angry and want to cut everyone out of my life. Sometimes I just want to be alone in my own little world without anyone. Sometimes I just want to cry and cry and cry. I've lost all grip on being able to control emotions.

I realize I have a problem, but it's beginning to get too late for me to save my relationship, and I feel like losing it would only make me even worse. I've lost all my friends due to me being an introvert and never having the energy to go out with them, plus switching to homeschooling because of the sheer amount/extent of the bullying I was receiving daily in school. I know that I need to get help. I've asked my mother countless times to called the mental health clinic I gave her a number for so I could get an appointment, since I can't do it myself (or so I've been told). She just says ""oh you're just being female"" or ""oh I forgot"". She believes my behavior is normal. I don't believe it to be.

Again, sorry for the huge wall of text. I just need outside thoughts, outside people to talk to who are complete strangers. I pushed myself really hard to make a post because I'm so afraid of what people think of me.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I don't know where to start...

I deal with mild to moderate depression, strong social anxiety and some general anxiety, mild tourette's (meaning my tics are on and off and can go into ""remission"" if you will; however, when a tic comes on it can last anywhere from a couple days to a month or 2, and affect me for nearly 100% of the time I'm awake.) My most common tics are sniffling, moving my nose around, grunting, throat clearing, doing weird flexing with my throat or abdomen, wiggling ears etc. 

I've sometimes wondered if I also deal with some OCD. I don't need everything I see to be all neat and tidy, and I don't constantly fear bacteria or anything; however, I would still call myself a germaphobe, and I feel like I have very obsessive thoughts.

Another thing I thought I'd add is that when I was in elementary school I was put in a class for kids who were slow, and my parents were advised to have me checked for ADD, but my parents, especially my Mom, are against those kinds of diagnoses and think it sets kids up for failure, not to mention they feel like ADD is a made up disorder and that being a space cadet or hyperactive etc. for a little boy is 100% normal. anyways, as you can imagine, i was never tested. once i moved on to middle school, i was no longer in any special learning class though.

something else i've noticed about myself, though it could be totally normal, i've wondered if it's not. although i'm a 23 year old male, and for the most part appear to act my age, I still feel very much like a child on the inside, and on top of that I haven't even remotely lost my childhood imagination.

another thing worth mentioning is that I seem to have developed a mild  speech impediment. i noticed this around the age of 20. it's become a lot more common that i stutter, slur or mispronounce words. it's not all the time, but it's something that's happened enough in my 20s for me to notice it's not normal and a new thing for me. 

so... do you think i'm just dealing with mild-moderate cases of numerous mental illnesses, or do all these things fall under a specific illness?

disclaimer: I'm not a hypochondriac. i know what a true hypochondriac is and personally know a few, and that doesn't describe me at all. although i deal with anxiety, i find i am quite rational at times where i'm not anxious; however, true hypochondriac can bring on anxiety just from being irrational, instead of simply becoming anxious which can cause irrational thinking.

anyways, i hope someone can give me some sort of answers. thanks",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Am I dealing with a specific mental illness with many symptoms, or just numerous mental illnesses?"

Tuesday was more of the same when we agreed on a time and place to meet up, and i found out that the materials I need to buy to pursue my future career are much, much cheaper than I thought.  I also scheduled my first vacation that I'll be taking on my own dime, by myself, and am incredibly excited for that.  I should be happy and excited right now, like I was yesterday.  But I find that I'm suddenly in the midst of some kind of crazy depression or something.

Most of yesterday seemed pretty normal, although that morning my grandma did make some sort of comment about me being in a sour mood.  I attributed it to the fact that we were talking about a topic that has stressed me a bit lately.  But then that evening when I got home I felt... Just kinda weird.  Like, normally I'm at a pretty even baseline, but it was like that normal baseline was coated in some sort of gritty, oily film... Like used diesel oil.  My parents (mom and grandma) both decided to dig into me about a short term business venture that I've decided to invest some of my assets in because my normal job is giving me shit for money in the next two weeks.  When I asked them how they proposed I make enough money to pay my bills this month they just said ""have you applied for any jobs?"", which is entirely counterproductive to what I'm trying to accomplish with my life and they both know it.

So I've ended up in this spiral of depression, anxiety, and anger, and I know it's bad but I just don't know how to stop it, nor do I know how I'm supposed to make it financially to next month ""the right way"" as my mom put it.  When I finally decided to go in my room last night I felt fucking terrible; like a complete failure.  I couldn't sleep so I plugged in my wireless headphones and started listening to music, but a short while later the charge on the batteries ran out and I almost started crying because I didn't feel like I could handle being so alone.

This isn't the first time this has happened, it's just the most recent and aggravating time.  I asked my grandma about it (who studied psychology and worked in the field for 25 years) and she said that it's like this for everyone; if they're happy for a few days they deplete their reserves of feel-good chemicals and whatnot and then they're down for a few days.  But this doesn't feel 'normal'.  It feels like a rollercoaster, and I want off.

In general, I find amphetamine to be much 'gentler' in terms of drug-dependency, requiring less frequent dosing and less monitoring. Treatment with methylphenidate in particular can be pretty harsh, because however powerful your desire and intention to be productive (i.e. not be depressed), it is a drug that gives and takes from you that ability with every dose and every re-dose. But the supposition that methylphenidate is a 'mild' stimulant and that amphetamine is a 'more powerful' stimulant, does not seem to be significant in regards to either of the drugs' effects on depression, although I have yet to experiment with higher doses of amphetamine (and honestly, I am not very enthusiastic about doing experiments at the expense of the treatment for my depression). I suspect that the metric of stimulant-power is based on a paradigm of drugs that are abused for stimulation at maximal non-toxic doses, so it is not surprising if it is unrelated to the use of the same drugs for depression at minimal effective doses.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Stimulants for depression: Ritalin compared to Speed

I haven't really done a lot of research on everything, so forgive me if I use some non-educated terminology to describe things. I will start off by saying that I have not seen any professional on this and don't really plan on it, I just want to know if there are any real disorders. I will now do my best to list the things wrong with me.

* highly paranoid

* very terrible sleeping patterns (I go to sleep at 1am every night, wake up at  4:45am, go about the day ready to collapse, then cannot go to sleep the following night until 1am again even though I'm super tired)

* I know there's a fancy term for it somewhere, but I do not know it. I always feel like there's some kind of big conspiracy going on. Always someone surveilling me, watching me, judging me.

* I overthink the consequences of things a lot.

* I always feel like people will judge me (not related to the above). Like, I'm really reclusive on sharing anything with new people or family members, even if it's as small as musical tastes. I always minimize windows when people walk into my room when I'm talking to someone online, even if we're saying things like ""Hello"" and ""What's up?"".

* Bipolar, though not very bad

* I am very reluctant to make any effort to form relationships. No matter how much I want it, something in my mind pushes me away from trying.

* Constant abstract thoughts and actions

* Very small, insignificant, infrequent auditory hallucinations (probably just normal)

* Rage that comes out of nowhere from even small things like someone moving an item around in my room. Rage that is very strong and really makes me just want to yell.

* Slightly introvert. I looked into this just now and aw that it involves hating small talk and loving to talk about things that interest you. Small talk bores the living hell out of me and there is nothing that bothers me more when making contact with people (which I rarely do anyway).

* Another that really bothers me. I think things in my mind that are really vivid (things I say or do) and sometimes, I have trouble remembering if I actually did that or said it. Like, I'll think of just standing up and yelling in the middle of a room, or be having a fake conversation in my head then, once it's over, think back and question myself with ""Did I just do that, or imagine it?"". These things seem so realistic, I feel that one day I will actually enact one of these by accident and not even realize it.

That's about all I can think of at the moment. The things that bothers me most are the paranoia and sleeping problems. I also have one more problem, but it's not anything I felt needed immediate attention (though it irritates the hell out of me). I have a ""shy bladder"". Basically, I cannot urinate in a public restroom while people are around and take ~10 seconds to get started going even when no people are there. In my own home even, I have problems getting anything out when I hear people near the door.

**Just a background**: I'm 20, male, and living alone. I have a good circle of friends and am active with some activities. Everything's pretty average here. 

Anyway, for the past few years I've been feeling incredibly lonely. This is weird, since I've got a couple of close friends (around 3, not a lot, but they're there) to hang out with. I don't get to spend time with them everyday, maybe only once a month because of busy schedules. When I've got time from school, I spend some moments walking around in parks, greeting people, participating in activities to engage in small talk. I really just do this so I could keep myself sane. 

P.S. And no, it doesn't feel like I want to have a girlfriend really bad. That would be nice, but it's not the reason why I feel this way. 

------------------------

How it feels like is this: whenever I go back to my room, wake up in the morning, or walk around the city, there's this overwhelming sensation of being lonely. It's not the sad kind of loneliness that makes me tear up, it's the kind of loneliness where I feel like someone dumped me inside a white, windowless room and left me there for a day. It is driving me insane. This wouldn't have bothered me so much (I really could've carried that burdened) except when this year the chest pains started happening. 

Every morning, my heart is incredibly heavy like I've been heartbroken for a long time, except I'm not actually even in any relationship. One particular moment I remember was when I felt like I even had a stroke. It was a scary experience, but it hurt that bad. It feels like I have a lump on my throat sometimes. Most days, I feel uneasy, restless, and unable to concentrate with daily activities. Although one thing I could say is I'm probably not depressed? I don't feel super sad, maybe just a bit all day, but not to the point I want to end my life. I just feel jittery all day because I feel like going insane. 

Anyway, I guess that's the gist of it. I pretty much wanted to ask if it was normal to feel this way? Should I be concerned that the chest pains have been happening for over a year now? What should I do about it? 

BTW, not a native english speaker, so pardon any language mistakes.

&gt; **Depression is an illness, and illnesses require treatment.** The World Health Organization releases statistics related to disease burden, aka DALYs. The final report organizes diseases and injuries in a list according to which ones result in the highest numbers of deaths, as well as which ones are the heaviest burdens in terms of recovery time, required treatment, etc. Guess what? **Unipolar depressive disorders*** (like Major Depressive Disorder, aka depression) **are ranked the 10th most debilitating diseases in the entire world as of the year 2011**. In Europe, it’s ranked the third most debilitating disease, and in the Americas, it’s the second most debilitating disease. In the world, depression ranks higher than diabetes, malaria, tuberculosis, certain types of cancer (trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer, to be exact), and cirrhosis, while in the Americas and Europe, depression ranks higher than road injury, stroke, Alzheimer’s, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, colon and rectum cancers, breast cancer, congenital anomalies, and hypertensive heart disease.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m not trying to say that having depression somehow makes you “sicker” or “more worthy” than people with other diseases - come on, sick is sick. Instead, I’m trying to get people to realize that depression is a serious and debilitating illness, and people who suffer from depression deserve to receive treatment and support. If a medication is not working for you (eg: it makes you feel “foggy,” you’re always tired, you can’t sleep, etc), talk to your doctor - there ARE other medications to try, and it can take anywhere from months to years to find the right combination of treatments for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **tl;dr**: Depression is an illness that affects millions of people from all walks of life across the world and is considered the 10th most debilitating disease in the world. If you or someone you know has a mood disorder,* treat is like the serious illness it is.

&gt; *The statistics reported by the WHO confirm that a number of mental and behavioural disorders are very debilitating - these include unipolar depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood behavioural disorders, idiopathic intellectual disability, and other mental and behavioural disorders. More information about any of these disorders can be found at www.who.int or elsewhere online. The best resource is always a certified doctor.

I have an issue in front of me now though that gives me pause and has me pondering this philosophy.

I've been friends with this guy for about 17 years. I'm 35 and he's 38. As long as I've known him he's been miserable. Over the years I've watched him slip further and further into depression. He's mentioned suicide a few times before but, recently it's become far more frequent and it's really the only time his mood seems to improve. I tend to think he's quite serious.

He's in talk therapy and treatment with a psychiatrist. He has plenty of supportive friends and family and this is where the problem comes in.

He listens to none of them. People try to help him, to be there for him and share their experiences with him and for the most part he just ridicules what they have to say behind their back. He thinks his problems are so unique and he's so much more intelligent than everyone else that no one is capable of understanding him and so their experiences and advice are inapplicable.

From an outside perspective, when he's given a choice, with one path improving his life and one making it worse, he will invariably choose the destructive path. This predates his current slide into severe depression. Honestly, I believe it's his behavior that causes and reinforces it.

Even when thinking clearly he seems incapable of choosing a positive direction.

Given his seeming inability to even attempt to improve his life, in my mind, like those with debilitating illnesses, he will never find peace outside of death. That said, I struggle with this because he's an old dear friend and from my perspective, he hasn't ever sincerely tried to fix anything.

I've come out the other end of this grief numb. I just don't feel things anymore, except paranoia, misplaced and intense anger, and the occasional firework of happiness.

I've lost all motivation. before, I would work out every other day, I was doing half decent in school, and I could be excited for a day when I woke up. Now, I can't bring myself to look at my homework. Every day I get home from school and I lose myself in other fantasies, be it video games or books.

I find it so hard to think about other people. What they might need, how to be considerate. I'm trying so hard to keep my brain focused just to respond to people in social situations, let alone begin to process how to think about what they might need.

Most times, I don't even react to things normally. Something will happen, and my brain won't even respond. I wait for someone else's reaction, and then copy them. It feels fake and forced, and I know people notice it, and I hate it.

I feel like there's this mass of molasses, sitting in the front of my head. It slows me down, I can't think properly, and thinking logically and connecting ideas is a struggle for me, something I overlook so often and so publicly it becomes embarrassing.

Often times, I'll go to say a sentence, and I'll start to stutter. It sound normal, but my brain gets stuck on repeat on one word, and for all my trying I can't push past it.

For someone who used to be quick witted and easily sociable, this is torture. I know the words and ideas are there, but getting them to come out is like trying to run up an icy hill.

The only reason I say I -think- I might be depressed, is that I don't feel a deep sadness, the way I see other people describing their experience. Maybe it's just because I've repressed my feelings for so long, but It's a stumbling block for me.

Let me first start out by telling you guys that I know I have my periods whre I am depressed and have had good help for that, so I know what the signs are and how to handle it. 

But there is one other thing in my life, I have major moodswings. And damn that shit is annoying as hell.

And then there are the moments where my anxiety gets the best of me and toys with me. Slaps me around like a ragdoll and makes the swings heavier.

And then I just sit at the house of my boyfriend and out of pure chaos and restlessness I will clean the fridge and stuff or just sit in a corner and bingewatch every show is worth clicking on. 

So not just going from happy to mad but from sitting silent in a corner doing nothing and going mental silently, to jumping around and picking up everything, cleaning jumping and dancing. 

God, this makes no sens to me anymore... Thoughts coming and going and destracting me, music that I want to dance to, thinking about diner, drinks, getting some dope for the weekend, thinking about getting a job an how that is failing big time.

I'm 20, at university (first year) and under no stress at the moment. I have great friends, family and a fulfilling life. I don't have trouble sleeping usually, and I sleep well and don't really have nightmares/sleep walking issues.

But for the past few weeks a few strange things have been happening. First of all I began talking to my friends about events that I recalled in the recent past (conversations about each other, etc.) that none of them say happened. 
Then I started forgetting days that happened in the week, lessons I've attended, people I've seen, people's names, etc. Not extremely, but enough to think wow, I should remember that it only happened yesterday.
I've also been experiencing temporary confusion with maths and reading sentences. I'm fairly well read and can read with absolute ease, but currently I'll read a sentence a hundred times and make no sense of it, yet a few days later I'll read it again with pure clarity.
Now, most recently, I've been sleeping...weirdly. A few days ago I slept for 20-odd hours and could've slept longer if it weren't for lectures, and yet a couple of other days I've been waking up to hallucinations through the night, for instance, hearing an ambulance siren on loop that I thought was in my room, seeing a girl pick up a pair of socks and hand them to me in my room, looking at my phone and turning off a constant alarm that wasn't actually happening.
The most worrying part of all this though, is that throughout this I've been feeling very depressed, and guilty. I've always struggled with guilt and I don't know why, even when I have nothing to feel guilty for I panic when someone talks to me, incase they find out all my worst secrets and hate me. This stems from a young age (since I can remember) I would get pangs of guilt all the time, like EXTREME guilt. Is this common in people?

Luckily, I have been able, for the past few months, to rationalise and deal with parts of it which I thank a lot of the advice here for.

**main problem**
It has emerged that my girlfriend of over a year and a half has a variety of mental health issues. PTSD is something i've known of hers for a few months now but she recently told me of her relapse into bulimia. She had it for three years and then started dealing with it, but it has come back. She has started occasionally cutting - which she hasn't told me about but I have seen. Nothing particularly severe, but the principle worries me. 

What can I do to help her. I am scared because she has entrusted a lot of reliance and responsibility in me - she tells me more than she tells anyone else and I don't know how to deal with the information. She hates talking about it and refuses to take my advice - she has a therapist and is on anti-depressants but I don't know what I can do.

I love her but am scared of the responsibility she has given me. It is also a long distance relationship in that I am at university at the other end of the country.  I am terrified of leaving her for what she might do to herself and don't intend on doing so.

I've got a boyfriend, and we just moved in together. My 'episodes' as we've called it have slowly been happening more often and have gotten more difficult.

A few years ago he had a complete breakdown, resulting in a hospital stay. He's been from test to test, doctor to doctor, but has had no formal diagnosis. At first we thought depression, but then there were symptoms of psychosis, reports of 'voices' and thoughts etc that made us think it might be something more like schizophrenia. He's been on anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and OCD drugs etc. Nothing seems to help his behavior - although his depression seems to have been improving a lot over the last few years.

He has not become convinced he has bi-polar (If he does something awful to you, he will say the next day 'sorry, it's my bi-polar'. The doctors seem to disagree. Though still no formal diagnosis one said he 'thought it was psychological'. They do not believe it is schizophrenia, bipolar or OCD.

Since his depression has improved his behavior has become unbearable. His mother is now his primary carer and he really treats her awfully. Demanding every small thing, and she can't *not* do what he wants because if she does he either gets very angry, has a panic attack, or goes into this strange toddler/baby mode. He also threatens to commit suicide (recently, literally using it as a threat. Saying you are *making* him commit suicide). When he gets upset he will storm off, which is fine. But then after about 10 minutes you'll hear shouting/screaming/banging, he'll lock himself in the bathroom and be very quiet, refusing to respond so we have to kick the door in to make sure he isn't attempting something. He'll scream at you etc.

He is at his worse with his sister (my wife). She isn't so forgiving as their mother and doesn't give him exactly what he wants. Things came to a head last year when he 'collapsed' in his room, blocking the door after she cooked a meal he didn't like (for herself, he didn't like the smell. It was lasagna). She went to check on him after hearing repeated banging. He refused to let her in, then tried to jump out of the window. She held him back. He stopped trying to jump out of the window and began throttling her to the point where she nearly blacked out.

Luckily he stopped. But wouldn't let her leave the room for a while. When he did she unlocked the door and phoned the police (a neighbor had called them after seeing through the window anyway). He then proceeded to put a knife against his throat untill the police arrived.

Once they got there he went into 'baby' mode and was taken to hospital. (What annoyed me was they tried to send him home a few hours later at 2am, with the person he'd just throttled...)

Anyway. So, that isn't really talked about. But my wife is obviously hesitant about spend time alone with him. But he still 'kicks off' around her. Last time he visited he started screaming. It reminds me of my little 2 year old cousin, his mom's attention is split and she isn't pandering to him so much so he basically has a tantrum. He gets lots of hugs and 'It'll be okay, we all love you' afterwards.

I've also noticed very manipulative behavior, which he did have a little bit when he was a kid, but is kind of malicious now. When he's in public with his Mom she can't put a foot wrong or he'll have a panic attack. He's also been sending strange messages to me and my wife explaining that she's forgetful, been acting strange that he's worried she may be getting very ill. (We asked her about this, and she thinks it might be because sometimes she can't hear him when he mumbles something). He also does things like talk loudly in public about how he's worried about her mental health, but other just plain mean things (refusing to pass her a sweet because ""she doesn't deserve one""). Personally, I consider it bordering on emotionally abusive. She has often said she feels like he is emotionally blackmailing her, and that he is trapping her. 

The worst thing is my wife has suffered from depression since a young age, and is just starting to repair a relationship with her mother. The stress of this really doesn't help *her* health.

I come from a family which (like most) has a lot of mental health issues, both diagnosed and not. I am an often upbeat and high energy person, something which I thought was just my baseline. There are times, however, when I become very depressed, isolating myself from others, sleeping more than usual, losing interest in things I normally love, and just generally becoming more agitated and angry than the type of person I am. The first time I noticed this I was in high school and I couldn't bring myself to speak to anyone. This lasted about a month and went away so I didn't pay it much attention. I am now 26 and episodes like these are becoming more frequent, but my depression is not the entire problem. When I am not depressed I am very upbeat with rapid energy/mood fluctuation. I am never manic (I have worked in mental health and have seen manic), but I am functioning at a higher energy than most. My problem is that with my rapidly fluctuating personality I feel like I am a different person on a (more than) daily basis which makes it extremely difficult to connect with people at a deep level. I have a girlfriend who I have dated for 8 months and she notices these mood changes, thinking that it is me not caring or not paying attention. I have tried to explain how I feel but can never manage to formulate a good explanation. I have an incredibly supportive and loving family but I have brought it up and had them brush it under the table as a fear response. I feel that me seeking any mental health would change my ""position"" within my family.

[deleted],,,1392874652,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1yf1u6/i_am_just_not_really_sure/,1yf1u6,True,0,False,1441904808,2,"I have a compulsive kind of disorder, trichotillomania. Obsessive hair pulling. Only I do not pluck hair from my head, so nobody really sees it. There was one situation when my sister saw it very recently, where the skin is very broken from constant plucking and digging out ingrown hairs. She was pretty shocked and not too sure what to say, she said it looked like an extreme allergic reaction to something. I have seen it in action that my mom exhibits these same tendencies, her spot is also not her head. Not a word has ever passed between us about it. 

I think about hurting or sometimes killing myself on a fairly regular basis, until I feel guilty that my dog would never understand why I abandoned her and try to let the thoughts go. I have never seriously harmed myself, but I do enjoy the trich it is many tiny sharp pains and then a broader pain after when the skin stings so badly and is further irritated by even light contact with anything really. I was proud of myself for going a day without it yesterday but made it up worse today. 

I have been to the subreddit for it but got scared and ran away like a coward. I do not think I could ever go back. I might never come back here. I hate myself. I need to grow up. I am fine. If I were somebody else watching myself I would say ""This bitch just wants attention, shut up and go away"" and that is why I will never go to a therapist because I know that indulgent, patronizing look that comes from adults. At my current age of 19 I have really bad hearing. I tried speaking to a doctor about it because I would really like to get a hearing test, I feel like I hear so little of what is going on around me. I have to ask people to repeat themselves to the point where they get angry with me. I honestly think I might need hearing aides. But I got that smile, and that nod ""oh you teenagers hear what you want to hear"" from my doctor and nothing ever came of it.

 If that is the reaction I got about maybe having a hearing problem what will they say when I go in with this? I pluck the hairs out of my legs obsessively and I think about harming myself but I know I am too cowardly to ever do it. Sometimes I can't bring myself to do anything even if I previously looked forward to it. Sometimes I eat until I hate myself then I sleep instead of working out or doing anything productive or to better myself because I am so tired but everyone around me performs much more physically and mentally taxing tasks on a regular basis and they are all fine. Sometimes I am so happy I laugh and I laugh and I feel like I am fall down drunk but I am totally sober. Sometimes I get scared because I feel like nobody can hear me even though I know I am yelling and but I can't get any words out. Sometimes I am so happy I smile all day and I tear up with joy and I want to tell all my friends I love them. I want to tell my parents I love them. 

And then I hate my parents and I hate my friends, I am jealous of them and I push them away, I say horrible things to them and I beg to take back afterwards but of course why would they put up with that? And then as a result I end up so very alone with nobody but myself to blame. Even my mom has told me I am not a nice person. And that is all a therapist will say. ""You are not a nice person. Plain and simple. Grow up, get the fuck over yourself and stop fishing for attention or compliments or whatever else it is you kids want these days. 99% of the planet has it worse than you now put your fucking tweezers down and get on with it."" I tell myself this every day. And I hate myself for being so pathetic. This whole post and everything about me is pathetic. In my short half hour on this sub before deciding to post everything was so heart wrenching how could anyone not look at me as petty? Every teenager on reddit is singing the same sad story and I want them to go away so it only makes sense that everybody else would want me to go away, too. I am so sorry I don't think this had a point at all. I had a friend who went to a psychiatrist at 16, and not only did the office lie to them about not disclosing appointment information to their parents because at 16 you have a right to keep your medical records private, the psychiatrist did nothing except tell my friend everything was really his fault and he should grow up. But then he prescribed him pills but never saw him again. I know that is what they will say to me. Grow up. You're happy sometimes and you're sad sometimes just like everybody else. You're fine. Go home.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I am just not really sure.

Long family history of all kinds of mental stuff (add, adhd, gad, sad, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar, ocd, etc). And I'm married. 

I have depression since I was a kid. I just didn't know what it was. I finally talked to a doctor, he agreed that I had some stuff going on, and I got on Sertraline, 50mg. I was feeling better, made the mistake of trying to go off, and shit slid downhill really quickly. Went back on, and stuff was mostly better. This was about a year ago. 

The past couple months, however have been very different. I'm aware enough to know that I'm probably in a depressive state. I'm finding that I want nothing to do with anybody. Nothing is fun anymore, they're all just black holes of money and time. But I don't want to just sit around and watch TV either. I don't particularly want to sit around and read Reddit, but it's the only thing that really seems to keep me occupied. I'm itching to do *something*, but nothing is scratching the itch. I feel like I'm wasting my life, even when all my friends and family think I'm doing very well. 

I am also finding myself on edge for no good reason. I get irrationally angry at people for stupid shit, but let the big stuff go. If somebody cuts me off in traffic, I lay on the horn and vividly imagine running them off the road and beating them to death. But if somebody were to verbally abuse me out of the blue, I'd probably just chuckle and go home. My emotional reaction to stuff is completely fucked up, but then again, those are the things I actually feel. Most of the time it's a numb indifference. I actually feel more for animals than people. Most normal porn doesn't do anything for me anymore. I started watching some BDSM porn that involves hitting people with canes and whips, and using very painful-looking nipple clamps, and that was oddly arousing. Not the actual pain part, but the presentation of the pain that they had. You could actually see the pain. I was thinking, ""I wonder what it would be like if I went to a pro and had her cane me?"" I don't want to turn into somebody who self-harms (or seeks to be harmed outside of my marriage), so that seems like a bit of a red flag.

My job is pretty relaxed, I am paid well and financially secure, and there's no risk of me losing my job. I can even keep it together as an enthusiastic, fun person during the work day. But as soon as I get home, it's like I check out from life until it's time to go to bed. Just doing the dishes even twice a week feels like torture. This is causing quite a bit of strain on both me and my wife. 

I do know that going to a Psychiatrist is the next step, but the outcome of it is stressing me out. I'm the one person who, on my mom's side of the family, got out of all the mental health bullshit and actually did something in life (even if I don't feel that way most of the time, I can recognize it objectively). Now I fear this is when all of it comes back. That I have some sort of anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder.  All of my cousins have something in these veins, and they're all kinds of fucked up, even though they're getting treatment. They work menial jobs most of the time. I fear that maybe the edge and unease I feel at all times is the thing keeping me successful. That maybe with treatment I'll become a fuckup, but with a drug-induced grin to keep me from realizing how fucked my life is. I am very smart, and I like to keep that edge very sharp. It's how I do so well in my job. I don't want to take anything that would slow down my thinking speed, even though I wouldn't be surprised if that was something that was causing anguish at some point. 

Anyway... does this stuff sound familiar to anyone? It just seems like a lot of whining to me, but I figured this might be a place where people can understand. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Depression or something more?

Link to public livejournal post here: http://1thousandnights.livejournal.com/2874.html

Full text below.

It’s funny how living with a mental and emotional disorder makes you feel like your problems aren’t worth anyone’s time. Especially when the issue you suffer from isn’t common enough for people to really know what it is, or understand it in any way.

Half the time, if you say “BPD”, people will mistake it for bipolar disorder. The rest will just sort of stare. It doesn’t sound too bad when you spell it out as borderline personality disorder. But when you find out the DSM-V wants to relabel it as “emotional instability disorder”, you kind of feel like they want to rename you as a lunatic who might just go insane at any given moment.

I’m not so much emotionally unstable— which brings to mind things like Fatal Attraction— I just feel too much. Sounds deceptively harmless right? It’s part of what makes it so hard to come forward about, because so often, it’s just swept under the rug as being “oversensitive”, when there’s a distinctive difference.

Where most people are sad, you’re grief-stricken. Where most people are annoyed, you’re angry, and anger results in fury or even rage. When you’re happy, you’re extremely “I just won the lottery” happy. When you should be down, you’re depressed. And when you should be nervous you’re anxious, and anxious— panicking.

And it’s not just sometimes. It’s all the time with every emotion you feel. It’s wearing, and draining. You love too much, and it’s hard to let things go, because old hatreds or dislikes still trigger heavy-duty emotions, even if you -are- genuinely over it. You’re easily embarrassed, and not because you actually care what other people think, humiliation is just a natural response for you.

Even if you’re diagnosed, it’s untreatable as a disorder. There’s no pill you can take, no therapy you can receive, no words to tell you “it’ll get better”, because it won’t. If you have severe, constant anxiety, they can treat that, but it might make your other emotions worse. If you’re severely, chronically depressed, you can be treated for that, but it also might make your other emotions worse.

The only treatment is understanding what is happening to you, and managing it. Tempering your rage, bolstering your depression or anguish, easing and soothing your fear and anxiety. Mostly, all you can do is help yourself.

Most of the people around you won’t understand. They think that the fact that you’re upset over something trivial is weird, or petty. Being hurt over something that wasn’t even offensive is silly. But it’s not like you can control it, and it’s not like you don’t -know- that it’s irrational. It’s out of your control, and all you can do is keep swimming until you find calm waters again.

I’ve often compared it in myself to walking through a desert in the middle of the night on the dark of the moon, blind, with only the promise of the sun on the other side to lead you. Sound dramatic? It is, but that’s because that’s how it feels.

Sometimes seemingly trivial things help. Tactile sensations often help, like petting a cat, running your hand repeatedly over a wooden bench, touching jeans, or clothing, or cement. Repetition is often soothing, like swinging, or rocking in a rocking chair. Certain sounds can pull you out of emotional explosions, despite the fact that you may have noise anxiety to go with your emotional rollercoaster.

Sounds like certain voices, certain types of laughter, the sound of the ocean, particular types of music (often times loud, hard hitting music helps me), certain types of movies, being outside, driving with the windows down.

Sometimes it means using unusual methods to bring your emotions to a better place. Listening to youtube clips or songs over and over. Playing with toys. They make you seem like a strange person, but sometimes you’re lucky enough that people overlook that to the person you really are. You’re not strange, or petty, just different. You feel differently. Your emotions are too big for the body you were given, and sometimes it hurts.

Sometimes you form connections with people you’ve never met, fictional or real, because something about them is relatable, and something about the way they carry themselves or talk, or laugh, or behave strikes a chord and gives you a face that helps pull you out of an emotional explosion.

My experiences have led me down my own unusual path of treatment. I go driving, or listen to hard hitting music, or watch the Avengers so often I almost have it memorized. I write, a lot. I have four hundred short stories since 2009, many of them unfinished. I also draw a lot. Since the same period I probably have about two thousand pieces of art.

The connections I’ve forged are unusual in their own right, as expected. The Ninth Doctor, Deadpool, Edgar Allen Poe, Jeremy Renner. People who, whether real or fictional, alive or dead, resonate with me in a way that helps me get through the tough times.

To a point- Jeremy Renner has been a touchstone because of the fact that he’s a real person, a person who embodies a lot of the things I’ve already aspired to- accepting challenges, doing what you love, enjoying life, not letting fear stop you in what you want to do. I’ve attempted to reach out (unsuccessfully but that’s not his fault, he’s a very busy man) to make him aware of the impact he’s had on my life and the fact that sometimes the only way I can get through an episode or a panic attack is listening to youtube clips of him laughing over something stupid or talking about the weird things that have happened during filming or on the red carpet, or at interviews. Or watching him act like a goofball pretty much anywhere, furthering the relatability because I’m my own sort of goof.

It feels weird, opening up to anyone about it, because you know you open yourself up for judgement as well.

And the worst part of it all isn’t just being judged for being what people often classify as “an emotional wreck”, BPD is almost always caused by emotional trauma, most typically from emotional abuse. You were literally forced into it by repetetive cues from another person, like I was. It’s a form of PTSD, but isn’t often classified as such, and yet it is, in fact, almost always due to post-traumatic stress.

Because it’s easy to just push aside as oversensitivity or as being “overemotional”, too many people think that they have no place complaining or mentioning it, because it’s “wrong” or “bad” or worse, “doesn’t even exist”.

The depression that accompanies it is not even medically considered depression (major depressive disorder, as it’s now classed), despite it’s chronic nature, because depression is so often classed as “any depressive period in which the subject’s mood decreases continually or does not increase over a period of two weeks or more.” (paraphrased). And since your emotions are mercurial, you usually aren’t depressed for more than a day or two, unless you’re having an especially bad time, when you might end up depressed for a week.

A large part of this essay is about awareness of what I and other people are dealing with, bringing attention to the reality of something a lot of people know little about, and teaching people that being understanding, even if you don’t “get it” is probably the most important thing you can do. Be aware, be prepared, and understand that the volatility and explosive nature of the person you care about, whether friend or lover, is a part of who they are, but has no real bearing on who they are as a person at the same time. Basically- we may not feel the same way you do, but we’re still just the same type of people with the same types of goals as you.

My tolerance is at an all-time low for the menial, monotonous bullshit of everyday life- all the tasks, errands, classes, homework (I don't even have a job; my life responsibilities are minimal, and yet I can still barely handle them.) I've struggled with this in varying degrees for years, but it seems like lately the overwhelming negativity and lack of motivation have been coming to a peak.

I've tried enough medications to know that sometimes they just don't work, because sometimes the problem is you- the way you think and the way you deal with things. I need to learn to cope with feelings of stress and boredom in healthy ways, and I need techniques that I can use throughout the day to just f-cking relax.

So, I started making a list of little things I can do to eliminate the negativity of my every day life. This is what I have so far: 

* Maintain written lists of everything I want to accomplish. I've had a running ""life to-do list"" for a while, but lately I've also been making weekly lists and daily lists. Writing everything down makes me feel way less overwhelmed because then I don't have to consciously try and remember it all. Also, I get a weird sense of satisfaction from checking things off the list. 

* Don't let the little errands pile up. Seemingly stupid tasks like going to the store to buy deodorant or cleaning the kitty litter really do add up once you've accumulated twenty of them.

* This is a big one for me: don't waste energy thinking about how much you don't want to do something- just accept that you have to and **do it.** Ruminating on all of the shitty things you have to do and how much you don't want to do them only makes your day that much more excruciating. 

* Once you're in class/at work/insert other place that you don't want to be, don't compulsively check the clock to see how much time you have left. This is easily the most effective way to drive yourself insane.

* Have some wind-down time at the end of the day, in bed. I've found that my tablet is great for this because I can read in the dark and it's a nice little ""transition"" time into sleep. On a similar note, give yourself time to wake up in the morning. Time to literally just sit there, drink your coffee, and mentally wake up. Even if it means waking up half an hour early, it really makes a difference.

* Exercise. Endorphins. Force yourself to work out in the morning. It doesn't matter if you ""feel like it."" You will feel so much better afterwards.  

* Keep your shit clean/organized. This is one I definitely haven't tackled yet and need to. Deep down I know that living in a filthy, unorganized environment does negatively affect my mood.

* Finally, try to ignore negative people. You can't always get away from them physically, but you can control how much you let them affect you.

TLDR, I want to improve myself and my life, and this is a list of ways that I'm learning to do that. If you're experiencing similar problems, please tell me some of the techniques that you've found helpful. Thanks!

For a while now, I have noticed something about the way my mind seems to work. I will never truly feel as if I am actually 100% conscious and aware. 

For example, I look back on something that happened half an hour ago, and I will realise, I was not actively thinking in that moment. This doesn't mean that I was not aware of my surroundings or anything like this, it just feels as if a 'shell' of myself was doing the controlling of everything, acting in the exact manner that I would, except my 'inner voice' was not saying ""You are aware"". Recently, I've become aware of this 'issue', so I go in to 'aware' mode where I think ""This is the current moment. You are aware."". However I look back at the time that I thought that, and realise I was not truly in the moment then.

I look back at some memorable things that happened in my week and realise that I felt more aware of what was happening in terms of things that happened either today or yesterday. Whereas, events almost one week ago have the stronger 'autopilot' feeling about them. Then I think back to memorable events months ago, and realise ""I was not aware then. I am now aware of the current moment"". 

**No matter how hard I try to be in focus, I will always look back at the moment and realise, I truly wasn't.** This is the main thing, which concerns me, making me feel as if time is just sliding away. This isn't a multiple personality issue or schizophrenia. **tl;dr: I just feel as if my mind is not often in focus of what I am doing in the current moment.**

I have asked others about it and no one else seems to understand what I mean. Perhaps someone with better understanding than me will be able to answer this. Key questions are:

- Do all people think like this?
- Is this simply a memory issue? (further back things are, the less conscious I remember myself)
- Is this something I should be concerned about? (The more I think of it, I know the more it will bother me)

They basically constitute somebody's opinion about depression, which is a mental illness on which I consider myself to be a fairly objective authority.

Quote:
""…if you think you're depressed and you slink around your house all day telling yourself ""This sucks, I hate everything and everyone"", then you ARE depressed. What you think is what you feel...

...Say you ask someone on a date and they say no and you promptly tell yourself that no one likes you, you'll never get a date, and you'll die alone, then that is what is true to you...

Did you ever think about why I'm so over-zealous all the time?""
End-Quote.


Sorry chubykid3, but I'm not going to let you make such facetious comments on depression, without offering you the distinction of my spiteful indignation. Scientifically speaking, the decision to believe in whatever makes you feel better about yourself could be described as willful self-administration of psychotic delusions.

Resurgence has a high-quality staff and high-quality players, and many of us generally have pretty bad-attitudes. Perhaps we even subscribe to the vampiric ideal that our enemies should be at the height of their power when we crush them.

If I ever ask someone out on a date then I *deserve* to be rejected, because nobody loves me except PurePlatinum. But did you ever think about why I'm so confident all the time? One of my heros is Royce Gracie, who is perhaps the only person who has ever been so good at hand-to-hand combat, that he could literally kill any other man who ever dared to face him.

So my answer to that question is simply this: no aspiration is too ambitious, no arrogance too bold, no enemy too powerful, no risk to my name or my reputation too great, to resist the singular thrill of confidence, earned.

In conclusion, let me point out three things about Minecraft that only a legitimate anarchist could appreciate:
1) I love creepers.

I want to discuss this post in more detail, because I think it represents a particularly empowering part of my personality, perhaps related to the phenomenon of a paradoxically prodigious mind, often observed in people whose life-long struggle with severe mental illness is ultimately dwarfed by much greater achievements in life.

To elaborate on this connection, consider three examples:
1) The schizophrenic mathematician John Nash, who in spite of his biographers is still alive today, and still discovering new mathematics.
2) The severely bipolar and lithium-dependent Kay Redfield Jamison, a practicing psychiatrist and author of *the* book on manic-depressive illness.
3) Paul Erdös, who was born with a seemingly hopeless case of multiple mental illness, and battled debilitating depression for most of his life. At the age of fifty-seven, when he finally resorted to a regime of successful self-medication, he was at last able to begin his career as the most prolific mathematician of all time.

Meanwhile the film ""A Beautiful Mind"" portrays Nash as basically a helpless and subservient victim of mental illness, completely undermining his remarkable contributions to mathematics. And Jamison was told by her psychiatrist that she should not have children, due to their genetic predisposition to inherit her mental deficiencies. These are people who never complained about mental illness, and yet it is believed that complaining would be their only legitimate aspiration.

As for Erdös, it is often hypothesized that he would have been a better mathematician if not for his addiction to smart-drugs, and that his drug-abuse problem could explain why he experienced so many symptoms of mental illness. I think that is particularly exemplary of the relationship between great achievement and the need to fight harder against stronger enemies.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Spiteful indignation or paradoxical prodigy?

There was a very shocking turn in my life a couple years back. I have told my mother I may need therapy for it. But all the ignorant woman said that therapy is expensive, asked me if I'm willing to pay for it, and asked me if I'm willing to give up my good grades to study in a lower, mental disability class. That didn't help.

Anyway. A major problem that I have is that I'm not able to make friends. I'm able to meet people and get close to them, but ever since the 'incident,' all the relationships I have seem to be either a) I talk to them out of developed habit, or b) it's just a mutual 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' sort of deal, there's no real love, no amitié. I'm also pretty much unable to feel emotions. I can tell the difference between when I am 'high' and 'low' but the 'lows' are the same 'lows' as as I feel when I'm ridiculously tired. 

There are also some triggers that cause me to feel down and want to escape life. I don't feel comfortable mentioning which recently caused me to remind me, but some of them include certain dates on the calendar.

I actually thought I was normal. Being someone who doesn't pay attention to detail, and being accustomed to this lifestyle for years now. However, there was one thing that really irked me: I couldn't remember my life before the 'incident.' The only reason I'm able to pick-up and recall some events is because of facebook and not doing a clean-up or so to speak of my friends list. Otherwise I would only remember the past 3 years of my life, and very vaguely too.

Having tucked these worries aside, I lived my life. Until recently. I decided to go back on my suspicions and doubts again, and the first link I found on google was this: http://www.cmha.ca/mental_health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/#.Uwq4P_ldV5K

This pretty much confirmed my suspicions. I really want to be able to live a normal life again, I'm feeling miserable, and I'm not even feeling comfortable sharing how I feel to anybody, including my parents and my closests ""friends"" for fear of getting bullied and kicked into a corner metaphorically.

As the title states, I get jealous easily.  I don't like it when people get things that I don't have, even when I'm not even sure if I'd want it.  If I then get that thing, I won't root against my friends anymore with respect to that thing but I'll find something else that I'm missing.

To explain my jealously, I think it's easiest to use some examples.

1. Before I had a girlfriend, I was always jealous of my friends who had them.  I would get depressed when I heard that one of my friends got some action.  Now, I've been in a committed relationship for over four years so I'm sincerely happy for my friends that are in relationships.
2. However, now that I'm in a monogamous relationship, I get jealous of the people who get to sleep around.  I get very jealous when I hear about stuff like people going to music events and getting laid, or the massive orgy that is the olympic village.  Having a great relationship, given my personality, is much more conducive to happiness than casual hookups and loneliness, but I still find myself jealous.  I'm not even close to a casual sex kinda guy so I don't know why I feel this way.
3. Now that I'm in my final year of college, I was getting very jealous when my friends were getting good interviews for high paying positions.  Even though I liked them and wanted them to do well, I was secretly so jealous that I was rooting against them, hoping they bomb the interview.  Fortunately, I've found a high paying position of my own, so I'm back to sincerely rooting for my friends.  But still, it wasn't a healthy mentality.
4.  On a similar note, I went on a ski trip recently.  I was sooo jealous of all the people who came from abroad to stay at the resort indefinitely and be ski bums.  Tons of hot 20-25 y/o foreigners skiing every day and probably having lots of sex.  It understandably makes me jealous, as I have had to work hard through 4 years of college.  At the same time, I imagine that if I were in their position, I would be super jealous of people like me, who get get jobs in their field doing meaningful work, as opposed to having to wait tables at night to pay for daily skiing.

Sorry for the long examples, I just wanted to get my point across.  I'm not depressed by any means but my jealously definitely limits my happiness.  I just want to be happy with what I have.  I always strive to improve myself but at the same time I'm in a really good position right now (committed girlfriend, extremely high paying job out of college in my field, no debt, white male in a first world country, no disabilities, etc).  What are some strategies I should adopt to improve my outlook?

-Ok, since this seems like I'm going to be writing forever, I'm going to leave what I consider my problems down at the very bottom after the break if you want to go ahead and skip my life story.


I live in Canada with my mother, I'm not currently in any form of school (I only have my Grade 11), and I'm unemployed. I'm 21, turning 22 in May And I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. That may sound cliche, but let me elaborate.  I'll try to quickly sum up what has lead to my current situation. (I want to be brief, but at the same time I want to cover everything just in case theres some root problem I'm not grasping, that might give me a better perspective on treatment)


I had a very normal childhood, I've always lived comfortably. I was in a catholic school from k-6 and public 7, online 8/9/10/11, honors student every year. My parents loved me, my dad had a bit of a drinking problem but he was never violent. it eventually lead to my parents separating, I lived with my mom and for a few years visited my dad an hour or so out of town every other weekend. It never really bothered me. My mother is/was very (over) protective and caring, I'm not sure how to describe my dads parenting style, he for lack of a better term was old-school. He cared about me, and wasn't afraid to be strict when he thought it was in my best interests. Living with my mother, I could practically get away with murder. But my time with my dad certainly gave me a better perspective and I would like to think I didn't act spoiled. 


I was always on the larger side (Part and partial to my moms inability to say no to pretty much anything), but enjoyed participating in physical activities. I was on my schools soccer team until my family doctor advised dropping out because of issues with my asthma (On a side note, I've come to blame a lot of my health problems especially breathing related on the fact that I was born a bit premature.), I took up swimming and but ended up suffering chronic ear infections as a result. I was in taekwondo after-school for about 2 years before I ended up burning out (School-classes-sleep repeat, recovering on weekends meant no time for friends) During this time I was also in an abnormal amount of car accidents while driving with my mother, 5 different collisions that lead to some serious back/neck issues that also contributed to my dropping out of taekwondo. Not one of them was our fault, 3 happened at red lights with cars crashing into us from behind. one was stopping at a four-way crossing for a police officer with sirens blazing (failure to stop would of resulted in T-boning the police car.) 4 car pile-up. And a final one getting out of the car to go to school, the lawyer actually tried to give us heck for not wearing a seatbelt, but the door was open and I was exiting the vehicle.


(random thought, sorry)
Early-on (g2-g3) I think I may have been a bit of a bully, which I believe mainly stemmed from my size. (Both height and weight off the charts for my age.) I mellowed out a lot as the years went by and I began to understand more about what others were thinking and doing and why. 


Anyways, everything continue normally up until the beginning of grade 8. The first month of school I made about 3 days. I spent most of the days laying in bed sleeping, when I would get up it felt like I had an hour worth of sleep. I couldn't function at all. Around the same time I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea (I stop breathing 40-50 times an hour while I sleep, and it partly wakes me up enough to correct the breathing keeping me from entering REM sleep) I enrolled in an online learning program. They are based out of a school about a 5 minute drive from my house. I was given the choice of which courses to take to fill a required point minimum for graduation. Most were done on the computer but some were by writing/printing projects and assigned booklets. 

I had a really hard time trying to keep any kind of schedule. Some days I would sleep 14+ hours and still be unfocused, others I could manage 8 and be somewhat fine, but end up waking super early for the schedule and being tired by the time it arrived. (trying to adjust for a longer sleeping schedule). I started having small problems with depression, but usually just around fall/winter, when my sleeping problems would usually worsen. 


My teachers probably hated me, because they would set a date for a series of lessons/tests to be complete, and I would finish them all on the last day. I found the work much more manageable as chunks dedicated to a single topic with all my focus compared to a more traditional school schedule. I had excellent grades in everything except math. At one point I even had a friend over regularly to tutor me, but some days it was impossible to focus enough to actually absorb anything. I've always been more productive in work where I can figure out my own process/solutions, the math work had always been too rigid for me to follow comfortably. 


I wasn't too happy with where I was, but I was taking steps to improve. I worked with a specialist through those years trying CPAP and Bi-PAP machines and masks to alleviate the sleep apnea with little success. And then I ended up in the hospital with chest pains and difficulty breathing, I had heart surgery to drain a fluid build up in the sac around my heart that was compressing my chest (pericardial tamponade). I spent several days in the hospital and it took me a fairly long time to fully recover. I had phantom pains and anxiety for a long time. It caused me to fall behind in school work thanks to my overly fragile and carelessly prepared schedule. I had the option of rushing inadequate work and not getting the grade I deserve, or starting over for the year. 


I guess that was 3-4 years ago now, my memory is shot for most of this time period. I've been living life on cruise-control. I keep up with online stuff, I meet some friends on the weekends. For awhile I was learning stuff through codecademy, html/css ended up losing interest half way through java (I still want to learn more, I can't just get my self interested in doing the work again). I self-taught (and maybe the occasional google/youtube tutorial) Photoshop, Audacity, and FL Studio, and some basic video editing to somewhat comfortable levels. Not enough to do professional work, but fun little projects when the mood strikes. Had what I would consider a mildy successful (personal) youtube channel since I only ever posted crappy videos for friends (several videos with ~15k (+-5k) views, and one with 120k)


My mom noticed a declining trend in my activity and it was discovered I have an under-active thyroid. I'm now on medication for that in addition to applying for a mandibular device to treat the Sleep Apnea as all CPAP/Bi-PAP trials failed to produce results at home. 


A few months ago I had a similar breakdown which lead to joining /r/lostit and buying a juicer. Like most of my interests the juicer thing barely lasted a few months, but I did pick up some good habits that aren't hard to follow. I stopped drinking that garbage high-sugar vitamin water. I haven't completely stopped pop but now its the occasional coke zero, and much more water. I'm extremely aware of what I'm intaking for calories and what those calories contain. Unfortunately my schedule doesn't always afford me three square meals a day, which doesn't do me any favours, but I've managed to keep a steady 1-1.5 pounds lost per week without starving myself of essential nutrients/calories. 


_____________________________________________________________________________________________


Anyways that covers my external problems and situation, lets move on to where I stand mentally.


People would describe me as very relaxed (Hard to get worked up when you're tired 24/7) and easy going (I honestly feel like I've just given up). I very much take life day-by-day with very little regard for tomorrow. I try to live with a smile on my face and a positive attitude towards just about any situation, I don't see the point in getting frustrated. I actually find anger/frustration highly toxic, even when its just people around me, it leaves me physically ill and mentally unstable.


I have trouble thinking for myself, Generally my decisions/actions are weighed as to what they would mean/look like to others. That being said, I don't often make decisions. I find it actually difficult to make up my mind on even extremely trivial things at times (what I want for breakfast for example) I'm constantly battling myself mentally over all my choices and actions. Recently I recall opening a door for someone as I was entering a restaurant and I mentally berated my self for several minutes after reaching a table for how I held the door. Even thinking back on the memory induces a cringe-like reaction for virtually no reason.


Posting in online communities it isn't uncommon for me to remember the post a couple minutes later, and think that I had posted something incredibly embarrassing/inappropriate and have to double check it. Sometimes several times, and often deleting the post.  

I like to think I have a positive self image, but behind that there are constant doubts. For every rude/scolding remark or comment I've received about my looks, choices, or decisions, I've gotten at least a dozen complements from complete strangers. I don't shrug any of them off, I try to be as humble as possible but it doesn't stop me from thinking about the reasoning behind the comment. 


My thought process at this point is completely erratic, I have to push to keep things together. My at rest mental state at times is a complete jumble of nonsense and noise. I jump from emotionless and lucid, to blissfully ignorant and empty headed, to agitated and confused for seemingly no reason. I internalise as much of it as I can to avoid looking weird in public, but I require alone time to centre myself after such events, or else I have trouble projecting a self-image of positivity.


My biggest concern is this mental wall I've developed. Certain things trigger me into what I can only assume are anxiety attacks. I would describe the feeling to be similar to when you need to take a breath and you can't get any air. The impending sense of doom and profound wrongness closing in on my chest. Whenever I try to describe my emotions in person this is a common feeling, I've actually had to write letters at times to properly express myself to people around me. I can't even make phone calls to strangers in fear I might say something stupid or regretable. When I order pizza with friends I usually offer to pay the tip in return for not having to make the call. My grandma lived with us for a few years before passing away, at the funeral I had tears but felt no sadness for her, I was picking up on the emotions of my relatives around me, it wasn't until months later when watching some stupid show that vaguely reminded me of it did I actually break down and cry.


I've seen a psychiatrist once and I only really brought up the first half of this post. And I got nothing in return, I expressed my frustrations with the challenges I was facing and basically got told I wasn't trying (in a more polite manor of speaking) Being non-confrontational I found it impossible to argue with anything he had said and walked out with a smile on my face and a deep emptiness inside.


Even while writing this post, I'm berating myself for asking for any form of help considering how good I have it. I'm reminding myself how many people have it much worse and they are able to solve their own problems.


I'm sitting at home, rotting away, my natural state is no longer neutral but mildy depressed and unsatisfied. I have a burning need to learn and improve myself and crippling doubts and fears around every corner. I spend most of my lucid time seeking distractions through friends, communities, and video games. My physical health has qualified me for government assistance which I use to take some burden off of my mother. Who to be brutally honest has provided no guidance or advice on how to live alone as an adult. I can say no to her at this point, but she has her way of almost never listening. I seek financial independence or responsibility at any level and constantly talked into ""later, enjoy this while it lasts"". I have no desire to form a meaningful relationship with anyone or get married because I feel like I would be subjecting them to my pain and heartache. I don't want to expose someone I potentially care for to such meaningless trauma.


I'm completely torn, part of me accepts everything as an inevitability and just goes with the flow, while at the same time I can see the whole situation and know it isn't sustainable or healthy, and yet I scold myself (internally) for even bringing these things up in what is a fairly harmless environment on a throwaway account. I could never post something like this on my main, my mind wouldn't let me. Its deeply troubling and at times like most in depression I've considered suicide. I've never come to the conclusion that its a viable option, what disturbs me is I can never give myself a reason not to that doesn't have to do with anyone but me.


Hell, I deleted my last throwaway post that was half as long. Though that was definitely more geared towards my struggles with my physical problems. I know the root of that is these mental blocks and anxiety, and I have no idea how to fix this. I feel broken, like my mind doesn't work like its supposed to, and I'm just projecting a construct of happiness that doesn't really exist to please those around me. Yet at the same time, I look at some of the things I've accomplished in moments of clearness and wonder if these things aren't just entirely my fault. I don't want pity, I don't care if the post is ridiculed, I just want to think straight and live a normal life. And I'm terrified the answer might be right in front of me and I'm just keeping myself from following through because of some fundamental flaw in my thinking.

I'm stuck in a rut of living day to day, growing more and more anxious/depressed/confused until I snap and something happens, and then the cycle repeats. Right now its a cry for help to some internet strangers, but I'm afraid if I don't break the cycle my inability to express these thoughts/feelings in person are going to manifest into some dangerous decisions/behaviors.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I don't even know what help looks like at this point [vent, long]"

So, can anyone help me out on how to get the ball rolling with this?  I want to get some places lined up for when he gets kicked out...which hasn't happened in a year thank god but the average is 4 months or so.

Please don't try to probe about him thinking I'm exaggerating...I assure you he is the devil incarnate.

He has been diagnosed with just about everything on the DSM-V but has only been arrested officially once, because the cops always just drop him off somewhere without filing a report.  

I know some people say you have to wait a while. but his private case manager always seemed to have houses lined up, and when he did not, it would only take him a week at most to find one.

Now, What should I do? How do I go about identifying the root causes?  Just an example: I've changed the companies I worked for 4 times in the last year (same position just different companies as I like my career) and I know the fault is most likely within me and not those companies.

because its is so common, daily.
cant listen to people, i zone out, with or without my own thoughts, when listening to my friends or family, lectures or even movies
zone out during exams, think about things completely unrelated, i recently noticed the same thing happened at a concert with my favorite band
cant pay attention, even in a job interview as i experienced the other day.
Cant stop fiddling, i have to play with a pen or pen lid, or rip paper, or have something in my mouth.
I avoid mental tasks like the devil, even when i consider myself relatively smart.

i will plan to work on an assignment and it would take me DAYS to get started, more then the time even needed to complete it.
My thoughts race so much at night makes it so difficult to get to sleep. unless i stay awake till exhaustion, which my schedule
does not always allow, it will take hours to sleep.

i act differently around different people. i have different personalities that i seem to base of how i believe people perceive me
due to this, i cant mix family and friends, i act completely different around them and i have no idea how to act around both.
same thing happens with two different friend groups.

i have multiple opinions on the same thing. i understand both opposing opinions but i don't actually have my own. for example:
I have a shitty McJob, a crappy uni student, overweight  - life is shit
i have a easy job with flexible hours and some awesome people to work with, getting by uni easily with minimal attendance and effort, free to do what i want - life is good.

i dont want to do anything. i don't want to grow up. i don't want to go to work, i don't want to go to uni, i don't want to get a real job and move on into the real world.

not suicidal in the slightest. i would never kill myself, but i would not be opposed to never having existed.

i guess im introverted. in high school once a fortnight i would pretend to be sick. this day i was home alone and it felt like i could recuperate my energy.
approaching the 2 week mark of school i felt really run down.
now, even after hanging out with my friends for the night i have the need to go home and be in my room alone afterwards.

I don't feel like my self. every action i do, i feel as if this is something that the real me would not do. the idea of me doing stuff is completely strange.
i feel like i am on auto pilot and just do whatever happens, then at the end of the day reflect and feel like the real me would not do the stuff i did, act how i acted, say the things i said, but then i don't even know what the real me is?

but the biggest problem isn't the problems, its thinking about the problems. i cant stop, ill spend 8 hours just going in a circle of thoughts about whats wrong with me and trying to figure out how to explain it.
and then i get caught up in the thought of ""is this how normal people act?"" and then ""do normal people think ""is this how normal people act"""" and then ""do normal people think if their thoughts are normal"" 

No motivation, or goals for the future. i see myself working a 9-5 coming home to an empty house till i die. i don't have anything to actually look forward too. i don't want to see the world, i don't want to do this or that, i just don't have any will to experience those experiences people look forward to.

i am a virgin, but that does not concern me. what does concern me is that im not interested in sex, or being in a relationship in the slightest. i don't want a SO in my life.

my main motivation right now is that i want to experiment with drugs. those feelings i want to experience is really the only thing i want to look forward to. I have my limits and know what i will and wont try. obviously its not the greatest idea if you have mental issues, kinda why im making excuses to put of trying drugs, other then marijuana which i use most nights.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, this may be a bit hard to read, its a bit of a collaboration of notes over time. 

I feel like i should see a therapist, but i don't want to, maybe because if i do, it makes my problems real.

I've never been diagonosed with any kind of mental illness, as I've never been to seek help with what goes on in my head. But basically i'm regularly depressed or incredibly angry (Only ever at myself). The depression I don't really mind as I've justified in my head (I have to justify everything) not commiting suicide. However I regularly (at most 5+ times a day) imagine various scenarios of suicide. For example sat at a level crossing waiting for a train to pass in my head il imagine me driving through the barrier at high speed and perfectly timed as I hit the middle of the track the train would hit my driver door. When I have these thoughts I don't feel anxious or upset I actually don't mind them. t's like wanting a piece of cake you know you can't have, but you imagine you ate and it was everything you expected it to be. But that's not normal.

Also I have regular ups and downs, but sometimes to extremes, i.e at the start of the day I can wake up in a good mood, convince myself that everything is fine and I have nothing to worry about. Then one thing will set me off and that's it, feels like i'm in the appocalypse with my thousand mile stare and anyone that was in my way I would just obliterate without a seccond thought.

I don't post here almost ever. But I'm looking for some help because I know (I think) the power of Reddit! I'm a college student from Ontario, Canada, and I have a project where I have to raise money for a charity using a form of Leisure. For example some classmates are holding a charity dodgeball tournament. Or doing a walk-a-thon. I've decided to try and do a 50 hour stream on twitch. Which will occur from March 29 - 31st.
I'm currently working on upgrading the page for it to look presentable. I will be streaming 5 times a week until the day, (I don't stream often).
I'm just here looking for help. My goal is to raise 1000$ towards mental health awareness. As I saw someone raise $8500 on a 90 hour stream that finished yesterday (I think). He's a popular streamer though.

If you guys have any suggestions, or anything that could help me out that would be awesome thanks guys!

Anyways, I suspect I may be bipolar. I try and shy away from self-diagnosing, but me and my CBT therapist (cognitive behavioral therapist, for my anxiety) both suspect this. I'll have depressive states and then random manic ones (more like hypomanic) and most of the times I have very volatile moods. She called it ""rapid cycling.""

If bipolar might be what's wrong, I'd like to get a diagnosis. If I am bipolar, it will significantly hinder my CBT and she'd need to go about my therapy in a whole different way. My question is, how do I bring this to a psychiatrist? I can't just say I think I'm bipolar. (In the past this has failed. I suspected I had anxiety for many years and I was misdiagnosed with ADHD. Even telling my doctor I suspected anxiety just ended up with me jot being taken seriously and brushing it off. ) 

Should I just describe my symptoms and mention I don't think it's connected with my anxiety? The biggest indicator to me is the rapid fire mood swings and whenever I get depressed,  within the week I'm ""fine"" and doing ""better,"" eveb my therapists will comment on how great I seem to be doing, as if the random depression never happened. It's never truly manic though, manic moods rarely happen but when they do it's like I'm on drugs. Euphoric, and motivated. I start a couple of drawings yet nevwr finish them, I get happy and excited about whatever I'm doing.Before tonight I never had a word to describe those moods.

Now, I really did not want to go, but I feel my mental health and clarity going as time goes on. However, after I graduate I plan on getting a career in a field where mental illness or even a diagnosis of depression is an automatic DQ.

And so I am a bit torn as to how much I should tell my therapist so as to not land with an 'official' diagnosis or land me in a mental institution. Of the topics I am concerned about, specifically they include drug abuse, suicidal thoughts, irritability and feelings of extreme anxiety/alienation. I am also terribly conflicted as most people see me as regular if just a bit serious. I attend social gatherings when invited and do just fine. I am a gym rat, and go to the gym everyday with my roommates. Most times I'm able to put on a fake show of charisma and charm, so as to not alert those around me or make them feel uncomfortable. I am enthusiastic in my expressions, and have become quite skilled at hiding that I'm mentally distressed. Maybe it's pride, maybe it's that what's going on is intensely personal. Either way, I am intent on not letting the people around me see my weaknesses. Not my family, not my friends and certainly not strangers.

My point is that I feel that nobody sees the shit I have on my chest and posting to Internet forums just doesn't help anything. Thus, I've opted to see a therapist/psychologist before things get visibly bad beyond me failing school.

After recent discussions with a friend about Irrational Thoughts and how we both deal with them, I got the idea for a mobile app. For both of us the best way to deal with these thoughts is to log them - we note the thought, what triggered it and how we can possibly resolve it.

It is the most paradoxical condition that I know in that it is both stunningly effective in its decimation of the human psyche and also the laziness way of being ill. Such is my summation. Who am I to reduce the work of numerous better educated doctors and the like to such a colloquial definition?  Well, having existed under the gloom of this horrible condition officially for 12 months (unofficially as far back as I can remember) I’m gonna go out on a limb here and name the monster hiding under my bed. 

My life on the outside looking in is pretty sweet. I am a final year student earing a pretty decent qualification if I do say so myself. By all rights, I should be looking forward to the next stage of my life with excitement on the level of your standard Directioner every time Harry tweets about his breakfast. Or maybe more realistically, terror akin to the sensation of the first day of school? Yes, mammy did just abandon you at this strange building, the new Spice Girls lunch box was all a lie. Instead, most days I feel nothing. Nothing penetrates the haze of self-loathing I have constructed around myself. I exist half in this world and half in a bubble of my own emotions. 

Those are surprisingly, the good days. The days when I am just cordoned off from the world by the fence of my feelings. The bad days are the days when the fence stretches the height of a six foot brick wall and collapses on me. By this, I mean the days where I am so irretrievably sad that I can’t even drag myself from my bed. I am marooned there. These days are the days when I will discover that I have run out of milk and will cry for an hour. You see, this will lead me to the thought that I am careless and irresponsible. That all my endeavours will fail and that my life ultimately has no meaning. Or that somehow, my roommate has taken the last of the milk as an indicator that she has always hated me because I am an awful person that nobody could possibly love and this is her subtle way of telling me. Nuts, I know.  On those days, my sadness is so acute that I feel actual physical pain. I wish I was exaggerating but my chest tightens and for hours there is an ache in my core. 

How so is depression lazy? Well, a tumour has to grow cell by tiny cell and ultimately cut off blood supply to a major organ to do any lasting damage. Depression takes your own worst fears and doubts about yourself and attacks you with them. It requires nothing more to decimate your life than the thoughts that exist in your head. Lazy or what! Plus, because of the combination of intermittent insomnia and often having to cling to my bed like a life raft to my sanity, I sleep more than your average newborn infant. It is not an uncommon phenomenon in my life to wake up, realise I will not be able to face the day, then simply roll over a sleep until 4p.m. You may say I’m a typical lazy student who is crying depression instead of facing the fact that they are just in a committed and loving relationship with naps! I wish this was the case because it would mean that I could stop. The lurking, oozing, creeping monster of my mind tells me that there is no point getting out of bed cause who would want to talk to me anyway. And the raft sinks, my chest tightens and the only escape is back to dreamland. 

The monster is a clever monster though. He is like that bully in your primary school that stole your mars bar and told you that only snitches tell the teacher. In such a way, this horrible bully has me totally convinced that I can’t snitch on him to my friends. If I told them then they would know that I wasn’t strong enough to punch the bully in the face and take back my mars bar. I am exhausted by the amount of lies I have to tell. I have guilt about the thought of burdening anyone with my problems so I lie. This leads to more guilt. To more hatred of the fact that truly, my friends don’t know me. They don’t know how much pain I’m in. But, it’s not their weight to carry, so I have carried it. This involves all sorts of made up adventures of days where in fact my only adventure has been a meandering course through the Land of Nod.

It has been a few years since the days of my junior cert. In fact it was in an era when iPhones didn’t even exist.. I know… how did we live?? Anyway, one line sticks out from this prehistoric education. Antonio says to his mate (his name has drifted from my mind due to the passage of time) “In sooth in know not why I am so sad, it wearies me, you say it wearies you”. This often strikes me as poignant and unfortunately relevant to my own circumstances. I often have no stinking clue why I am so sad and it is bloody exhausting (see paragraph above on naps!). It is the next part that I am fixated on however. Antonio’s friend says it wearies him. But does it actually? Does he only pretend to care because it would be too awkward not to and in fact he has a high speed gondola ready to get the hell away from this nutcase?  And what does he mean by weary? Is he so sick and tired of Antonio’s whinnying and buzzkill demeanour that he can’t wait to run off to the girl with the caskets? (It’s coming back now!) Is he exhausted from the effort of worrying about his friend which certain monsters may remind you is an unacceptable demand on your friends? Or by weary does it just mean he is concerned and willing to help? Does the meaning of the word weary vary with the character you slot in front of Antonio? Shylock wouldn’t be impressed, I don’t think… 

What is the point of this monologue you may ask? Well, I have been stuck in this hole for a long time now. Being a student, I have a stereotypical lack of solvency. My university, while fantastic in certain respects, can only offer me eight counselling sessions a year. I’ve put off going when I desperately needed some help, for fear that I may use up my allotted time before exam period when I particularly struggle to be motivated. It’s ridiculous how much that monster wants me to fail. He allows me to be the personification of a perfect student for most of my life. Then, once I get to college he locks my concentration, motivation and drive in the far recesses of my mind. I swear to god, I would love nothing more than to punch the little bugger. My doctor has said that she doesn’t want to put me on medication. I can’t help but agree with her. The side effects of antidepressants scare me. I don’t want to become a version of myself that is just constantly set on average. I want to be able to feel the soaring highs and crushing lows of life. I just so wish that I was less fixated and less destroyed by every low that comes my way. I would love counselling to work for me. But the truth is that one session every couple of weeks is not going to cut it. It can’t help me deal with all the empty milk cartons I encounter.

A couple weeks ago, after the third suicide, [this article](http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/02/newton-suicide-stress) surfaced and made its rounds around my Facebook feed. While the writer does make some good points and there is almost certainly *some* link between school stress and depression, the article...almost made me angry. I'm not going to pretend to know the stories of the three young men and women, but I know my own story.

I took one of the toughest courseloads in my graduating class. I was also depressed. It'd be so easy to look at the two and say they're related, and yes - I did face a lot of pressure from my family, my peers, and most importantly from myself. But that wasn't what drove me into depression - no, if anything it was what helped me survive. It'd be a bit of a cop-out, almost. 

Everybody is different, and maybe it *is* causing depression in students, but when I saw so many people sharing the article, I was so scared that every case of depression would be pigeonholed into a case of school stress. I was afraid that cases like mine would be overlooked, that the system would think they had fixed the problem when all they had really done was patch over one of the many holes.

Then came [this article](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/02/newton-mobilizing-after-suicides-teens/ddoqf9XlrCPhEl6fbd2KYI/story.html) today. First of all, I'm glad that people realize the situation is much more complex than it appears (making all that I wrote above pointless, eh).

And I know I said I'm not going to pretend to know the stories of these students, but reading this article...I was stunned. Roee's story is eerily similar to mine. My family came to this country and this city when I was 3. I loaded up on honors and AP courses in 11th and 12th grade. He skipped 10th grade math by self-studying the previous summer - I did the exact same thing but for 9th grade (and this really wasn't all that common of a thing). It makes me wonder how many other kids are going through what I went through, what Roee went through.

I'm not entirely sure why I wrote this post. I think I just needed to get a lot of this out of my system. But...I feel a slight urge to do something about this all. I think depression is something you can't entirely understand unless you've been there yourself (and that's what makes it so hard to tackle). I'm not sure what I could do - I hate speaking up, but having been there myself and still being there from time to time, I almost feel like - cocky as it sounds - that I have a better understanding of what's going on than most.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My old school district has suffered three suicides this year.

So basically I have always been a worrier which never really was a bad thing. I had my highs and lows like normal people do and always considered my self to be fairly ""normal"" with few quirks and ideals that would differ from most people. However, things started to get pretty bad the end of my senior year in high school, after smoking weed with my friends I had a major panic attack which led me to believe I was dying, life wasn't real, reality was just a dream ect. The next day was horrible, I pretty much suffered a panic attack the entire day and could barely function at the social gathering at the time. My girlfriend at the time tired to make me as comfortable as possible but it was hard because I had no idea what was going on or what was happening to me. Finally, after dry heaving and shaking some more I told my mother what was going on, this was big for me because I really don't like to worry my parents or let them in on my personal life. At the time though I didn't care. We scheduled doctors appointments and I got a therapist, this was the summer before I was to go to college. At the time I had feelings of being unreal, no-emotions, and a brain fog that didnt seem to go away. I was eventually put on prozac 20mg and continued throughout my days and eventually the derealization/depersonalization went away. Pretty much from when I started college until a few weeks ago I had no major episodes or similar feelings from the time. A few weeks ago, I came back from a party with my friends and someone in my hall offered to smoke me up. I had a few to drink so I said sure why not (I have smoked again in moderation with no bad effects in between). This time though he gave me a big hit, and my tolerance was low, it was stupid I was feeling alright until I went into my room and completely bugged out. My body was tingling, my heart racing super fast, similar to when it happened about a year and a half prior (The fear was a bit less but I think that's due to the meds) . I called my friend back in because he also said he was too high after smoking and had me calm him down. Eventually, I passed out and woke up feeling okay but a bit dissociated. Since then though I've been experiencing the dp/dr again, no emotions, no drive, passion gone. I am really just looking for some help because I freaked out at 5 am when I randomly woke up for no reason. I don't know why this is happening, my home life is good.

It’s focused on one guy in particular.  But it’s spread as he now thinks nearly everyone has either lied to him or opposed him.

I thought he was doing better but today he shared that he thinks they are following him, watching him, breaking into his home to investigate his computer, filming him while he’s in the shower and showing it to women at work.  He thinks they’re tracking him by his phone.

He told me he’s contemplating murdering people but he won’t, he’s working on a law suit instead.  I told him he’s been my best friend for 30 years and I do not want him to go away.  He said he’s not going to do it, that’s just how angry he is.  He’s working to start a law suit and think they won’t think he’ll go through with it.  He thinks the only reason he isn’t fired is that he has an active HR complaint.

He thought I was tell him I didn’t believe him.  I told him I never said that but he explained how I acted when he told me those things.  I told him I don’t know what to do and he said nothing.

Well, guess I won't do anything.  I called the mental health crisis center and they have no way for me to do anything without him knowing it was me.  Their definition of insanity is very narrow and if I think he needs an eval and refuses I will have to file a court request where I testify why he needs one.  If I think he's a danger I have to call the police where I'm the one that's his accuser.

There have been no threats, nothing that anyone can take any action on at all.  Only me being worried about my friend.  The only options any professional I have called has presented to me will destroy that friendship, cause him to see his only remaining friend as a betrayer, and make things worse.

I don't know how it happened, I don't know the exact day or time I started believing it, and I don't know why I can't dislodge this feeling. It has me spending hours of my days, continously trying to find what is wrong with me. If I have OCD, schizophrenia, NVLD, autism, WHATEVER. And this isn't a thought, it isn't a worry I can't dismiss. It literally is the focus of my life. It feels like time has stopped, days just repeat, that I have no narrative. That all that matters is doing this.

This isn't an intrusive thought, either. If I'm not focused on this idea I literally do not know what else to be. So often I ask myself ""what other thoughts would I fill my head with?"" Obviously thoughts of my life, where I'm going, etc. Yet it feels as if absolutely nothing can be resolved, no step further taken, before I solve this.

It's causing me so much anxiety. I fret that I have some incredibly damaging psychological disorders. I am hyper vigilant. I monitor myself constantly to see if I'm demonstrating any traits associated with whatever mental illness I think I have.

There are hours and days when I snap out of it. These come from nowhere. I realize I am being absurd. My sense of life and self flow back to me. But typically, I give it time and it happens again. Vicious circles of thought for days.

I had some paranoid thoughts and had a what I think to be mild anxiety attack. Ever since then I have been feeling uncomfortable inside my own thoughts, constantly needing some kind of distraction to keep me from having what feels like some sort of panic attack. (Note that I have never had an anxiety attack nor a panic attack but these terms seem like they come the closest.) The panic attack feels like the following: I get chills down my entire body, my heart starts beating faster and I get a little panicky. 


Now the thing that scares me is this: I have no record of mental illnesses or such so it feels really scary to not feel safe inside my own thoughts, since there is no way I can escape my body. It may have something to do with my grandma dying the past week. 


Here's some personal information about me if that might help:

I'm 16 years old. I have not been very emotional about my grandma dying at all. It's probably because we saw her death coming like 2 months ago and I have been dealing with it bit by bit day by day. Maybe it has something to do with that? I don't know. The whole experience feels like I'm stuck in some sort of bad drug trip. 


Please help /r/mentalhealth, you're my only hope


EDIT: To add to this, I've also been feeling a little paranoid and I have trouble getting to sleep. The sleep problem probably has to do with my thoughts and whatnot. Once I'm sleeping though, I won't wake up until it's time to wake up. I also don't have nightmares or such. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Don't feel comfortable in my own head

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for 5 years. We see each other most weekends (Due to me being 3 hours away at University). We're both 20 years old and live in the UK.

When my girlfriend was still in high school (5 years ago) she was a very happy girl. After high school, she moved to a different college than all her friends moved to. She has since grew further and further away from her old friends and hasn't managed to make any real new friends in her college. So her only friends are my friends (which is completely fine).

Over the last few years she has slowly become more and more depressed, originally it started with her getting upset about not having many friends. But it has gradually got worse, to the point where she constantly has sleepless nights and nightmares.

She has also started becoming very anxious, she worries about every little details. She has passed her driving test but won't drive anywhere unfamiliar. If she has to drive somewhere she worries about if there will be parking and if not, where she will go. She even checks up the entire route on google street view if she's not 100% sure where's she's going. 

She also worries about going into public places, talking to people and a lot of other things. She worried herself for 3 days about taking her car to the car wash and when she got there she was shaking with nerves.

She has now gotten to a point where she no longer sees the point in life, and that it would be much easier to die. She say's the only reason she hasn't committed suicide already is because of me.

It might be worth noting that in the last year she has lost two people close to her. A family friend and a work colleague.

I have tried countless times to get her to seek help. A few months ago I spent days trying to persuade her to go to the doctors or tell her parents. In the end she ended up telling her Mother that she was depressed and anxious (but not that she's suicidal). Her Mother basically told her that she still has them feelings herself and that it's fine.

Now last night she woke up having a nightmare and I spoke to her on the phone and the suicidal thoughts came back to her. So I tried again to persuade her to go and see the doctors but she's having non of it. Saying that the doctors will think she's stupid and that she's wasting there time. Even after me explaining countless times that doctors see this sort of thing everyday and that its fine.

The really annoying thing, is that she lives so far away, so I can't go to the doctors with her. I don't know what to do anymore. I spoke to her earlier and told her that if she doesn't go to the doctors I will have to call her mother and tell her that she needs help.

I'm really stuck on what to do, does reddit have any advice?

Should I actually call her Mother? Even though she might just say it's normal and then make my girlfriend feel like she can't talk to me about things.

The problem I have noticed is that after only two session I'm starting to feel really uncomfortable with my therapist as I cannot tell if she hardly talks because I have said something that disturbed her or if she simply doesn't know what to do given the information I have provided about myself and about how I have been feeling. Specifically, we have discussed drug abuse, my abuse as a child, my general background as well as various other traumatic events from when I was a child. However, after mentioning these things to her, I am starting to feel very uncomfortable as I feel like an animal being studied by a researcher of some type due to her limited participation during our sessions. I mean she just sits there and stares at me with a nervous kind of look, and I see in her face that she isn't sure what to say or do. It is as if she is scrambling to think of what would be the right thing to say, but the little she does say comes out very scripted and serves to just remind me how unnatural it is that I'm pouring my heart out to a stranger in hopes they can help fix me. Maybe its merely because lots of what I have already told her would probably be considered abnormal, but another part of me feels that this woman (not more than 6-7 years older than me) is just really inexperienced and that is why she doesn't know what the hell to do with me. If I recall correctly, on the university page it states she has only been working since 2012 and graduated the year prior.

So could someone please give me some insight into whether they have felt this with their therapist because at this point I just kind of regret ever initializing therapy when it would seem that not even a professional can help me.

He's been dealing with this for about 2-3 years now. He said he first started experiencing the symptoms after practicing deep meditation. He's stopped meditating since then,

The visual hallucinations are primarily flashing and dancing lights. Very bright lights, similar to what you'd experience on peyote. He also sometimes sees walls and ceilings 'breathing', and whenever he focuses on anything, like stuff with patterns or textures, he sees particles moving around/swirling on the surface. Similar to when you look through a chainlink fence for a while and it messes with your vision.

He also gets imprints in his vision constantly and they last for a very long time. (You know how you stare at something like a lightbulb, look away, and still see it for a minute? It's like that, but the imprint lasts for much much longer and impairs his vision.)

The lights occur the worst at night when he's trying to sleep. He also sees trails of light and tracers constantly that aren't there.

When he experiences these, he often feels a strong sense of dread or terror. Very ominous. This causes a lot of anxiety for him, so sleeping has become very hard for him to do.

He doesn't drink or do drugs, but the hallucinations and anxiety can get so bad that he's had to take xanax several times just to function. It's very very difficult for him to work or go out and do things without these problems bothering him.

I'm very concerned for him and we're trying to get him to see a neurologist, but it is very expensive and may take a while to get him in to see one. Does anyone know if these symptoms are connected to any specific disorder/Have you experienced such symptoms? I appreciate any answers I can get.

Having carefully and precisely cleaned it inside and out, I set it down, and admire it.  It doesn't feel like too long before I look up to see that an hour has passed since I began my admiration. I understand I have an obsession, an incredibly strange hobby, that's what most others say, when they see this process. 

But truthfully, the time staring is not admiration. Each and every second is filled with vivid and carefully thought out internal images of me taking this beautiful device, this heineous machine, and ending my life. I think of how to do it so that others won't have too much fus cleaning me up. I think of how to do it so that the round won't over-penetrate, and hurt an innocent person. I think of how to do it so that my family will find the note (which I've never gone so far as to write) before they find my body.

I look at the clock, see I've spent an hour, or so, in this abysmal hell, and hate myself.  These machines, as I have many, are my best friends. My rifles don't hurt me, because I always know how to treat them right. A proud Marine once told me ""This is your rifle, if you take care of it, it will never leave you"". Using my best friends to hurt their only human is not taking good care.  But each and every time I finish cleaning one, and yet never at the range or within reach of ammunition, I have at least one thought of concluding my story. 

Despite this persistant agony, I know why I don't seek help, and why I never act on my daymares: I am too proud. I can't admit to my folks, lone human friend, coworkers, or doctor that I have these thoughts. I can't admit to them, because they will want to know the source of the problem, and I can't admit to them that it's because an ex-girlfriend is accusing me of rape.

I commited no such crime, but as our age difference was significant during our relationship, the investigation into the phony crime would be detrimental to my life, as a whole. No school is going to hire a counselor who has rape on his record. 

So, as I apply the lubricant to my Bolt Carrier Group, knowing full well where my mind will soon take me, I wonder. I wonder why, when I felt so much love for the girl I dated, and received much back, that she would want to hurt me so. I wonder why she wishes to cause me more grief, than that which I suffered with the disentigration of my reputation: having told my peers of my 19 year old relationship with a 15 year old. I wonder why, though I was willing to delay any sexual gratification for many years and was willing to reduce my reputation to the smoldering pile of a perceived pedophiles, she wants to hurt me more.

So, here I am. My Rifle is spotless and safe, having been taken care of properly, it will function completely, and bears me no ill will. I have a perfect machine. It responds to maintenance and lubrication with flawless performance. Yet, all I can think about is placing its barrel in my mouth, chambering one final round, and rendering myself inopperable.

I will never do it. I will never load that last cartridge. That is the act of a coward, or at least, that's what society has bred me to believe. I hate myself, a coward, more and more each day for these thoughts. I hate myself, a rapist, more and more each day for the guilt of a crime never committed. 

My Rifle has never hurt me, but I want it to. I want my rifle to behave like the girl I loved, I want it to bite back. I want it to treat me the same way she did, so that I can have the courage to do what I didn't with her. So that I can stop treating it the way I know it needs to be, even though it has already hurt me. So that I can finally stand up to it and say that I know I never hurt it. I want to tell my rifle I know I did not earn its punishment, and in that way disgrace it.

Loading, and firing, that final cartridge would tell my rifle precisely what I want to: you will not rule my life, you will not get the reaction you sociopathically desire from me. Loading and firing that final cartridge would free me from this cycle; but the cycle is not meant to be broken.

I will, maybe forever, treat my rifle the way it is meant to be treated, and it will never act unexpectedly. I will repeat this process over and over, attempting to see some deviation from the nrom. Attempting to somehow rationalize why she would do to me, what this Rifle never will. I don't want the guilt from her anymore. Just because I love her and feel ashamed that somehow, some way, I caused her to somehow need this  power over me. I somehow pushed her to grasp the corner of my entire life, and prepare to tear it all away by claiming rape. I feel guilty because I may always love her, and she feels nothing towards me. 

Help me, please. Somebody, anybody, tell me how to fix this.

She said that this guy is better than me in everyway. He has no job and lives with his dad. Im 27 make 50000$ a year and care very much about my family. I'll admit I made mistakes in the marriage, but I never cheated and never was abusive.

I had smoked pot a few times before, and I always seemed to get anxious and paranoid after doing it, but it was nothing compared to the effect of what I felt after taking the decent-sized brownie. It also probably didn't help that my friends and I all went home after taking them. Anyways, that whole night is mostly a blur of me being extremely anxious and texting my friends that I feel like I should call an ambulance. I convinced myself that I had water poisoning and started making these crazy assumptions of what could being happening with me, but in reality, I was probably just really high.

I remember feeling ""high"" for about 2 days after that, and about a week after my experience I started to feel a detachment from reality. I tried to shrug off the feeling and live on but it wouldn't go away. About 3 months after that, I started to get panic attacks almost every night for a weeks that would consist of my shaking or shivering in my bed without being able to calm myself down, and for a while I started hearing voices shout my name before going to sleep. I became obsessed with finding out what was wrong with me, literally it being the only thing I would think about, and started googling symptoms and convincing myself I had schizophrenia among other diseases.

So as a defense mechanism, I tried to shut out all of those thoughts. To this day I still feel like I don't have a ""connection"" to my thoughts. It's like I don't know what I'm thinking about because I'm not listening to them. The best way to describe it is like my inner voice is muffled in a way. I tried seeing doctor and I got prescribed anti-depressants in about Feb 2012 (Sentraline), but it didn't seem to help me much and made me feel even more suicidal at points. So I kind of just tried to fix myself for a while, starting getting better grades, and lost all the weight I gained from stress eating in that time and beyond that. It didn't help though and recently I tried seeing a therapist in Dec 2013, where I told him what happened. He basically tried to connect the problem to other things that were going on in my life, so I stopped seeing him.

Now I'm kind of at a loss of what to do. I have basically fixed all the problems in my life that I could. Besides not getting enough sleep, I'm healthy, my grades are good, and I have set myself up well for college. The only thing keeping me from happiness is this feeling that I am not here. It's like the world is always unfamiliar to me. I feel like my conscious, the things that makes me ""me"", isn't there and it's just my body on auto-pilot. It's like I can see what's in front of me, and know what it is, how it feels, etc., but I can't grasp the feeling that it is there. I don't really know if this sounds crazy or not because I'm so used to it by now, but I wish it could change. I can't go out and meet new people because I feel like I don't know what to talk about with them, but all I want is to be able to have some good friends and not be so lonely all the time.

Sorry for this turning into a rant/sob-story, I meant for this to be more concise but it's kind of a long timeline of what I've been dealing with. If anyone could give me some insight on what I'm feeling and give me some advice on what to do, I'd be really grateful.

I became catatonic for an hour and when my partner rushed home to find me in bed, in her attempt to move or touch me I began shrieking and crying.

Ever since this day I have become very insecure and less trusting. I have everything going for me and I've built a great little life for myself in my mid 20's, but I have never regained the psychological fortitude I once had since that day.

If this in't the right place to post this, I'm sorry, I just don't know where else to talk about this.  I'm also sorry for the length.
  
I am, and have been for some time, a recluse.  I do not enjoy leaving my apartment, nor opening myself up to people.  I am not socially awkward, I do not dislike people, I just feel vulnerable outside and in regards to intimacy.  I avoid social responsibility, obligations, and intimate connections with people and it is taking a serious toll on my mental health.  I am 26 and have never had a girlfriend, or any meaningful romantic / intimate relationship.  I've never had sex.  I know that I am fully capable of going out and obtaining these things, but I have no drive to, and that confuses and scares me.  I have dreams about having a relationship.  What it would be like to be loved for who I am, not like with friends or family.  Then I wake up and try my best to forget the longing I have.  I want more than anything to be loved, but at the same time I'm terrified of opening myself up.  I've convinced myself that I'm not worth a damn, that people would be better off not knowing me, that I have nothing to offer even though I see the fallacy of that.  
  
I can clearly see that these things aren't true, but that is what I know, not what I believe.  There is a disparagement between what I know as truth and what I believe is truth, and I cannot reconcile those two different parts.  I know that I am attractive, smart, funny, and have a good nature.  I believe that I am ugly, dumb, and am a bad person.  I am scared of sharing myself with another person, and the thought of getting naked in front of someone makes my skin crawl.  I'm not asexual, I get aroused by women and follow through on that by myself.  I fantasize about sex and love, and as mentioned, frequently dream of those things.  Yet, I don't act on those feelings and I don't know why.   
  
In high school I was a pretty standard guy, albeit strange by most people's standards.  I 'hooked up' with plenty of girls, and had numerous opportunities to have sex, but always let them pass.  Overtime my sexual encounters made me feel more awkwardness than pleasure, and eventually I stopped altogether.  I haven't kissed or held someone's hand amorously for 5 years.  
  
Some days I feel like I'm going out of my mind with loneliness and longing.  On those days, it takes everything I have not to give into feelings of worthlessness and full depression.  I've flirted with depression for a long time, but have never given in to it luckily.  Objectively, I've analyzed suicide as an option, but never seriously considered it, nor do I struggle with the temptation of it.  
  
I feel trapped in limbo.  Destined to walk the earth as a shadow of who I could be, and what I could accomplish.  I feel, perhaps erroneously, that if only I could find someone that loved me, I could love myself.  I am 26 years old, and I feel like my life never began.  I feel like I'm waiting for something.  Waiting to become who I know I am inside, but it never comes.  Of course I know the falsehood of those statements.  I know that it is up to me to steer my life.  It is the choices I make that determine my position, but I believe / feel that I am incapable of making those choices.  I feel like I don't have control of myself, or that someone else is guiding my hand.

I suppose I could sum this all up by saying I feel disconnected, but am too scared to do anything about it.  I really need to connect to someone, but there isn't anyone in my life I can go to with this.  My family doesn't understand, and their advice is like a picture of water to a drowning man.  I've tried counseling, hypnotherapy, medication, meditation, and psychology but my head always defeats the attempts.  I crave an intimate connection with a woman, but fear I am incapable.

I used to be smart. AP and honors classes, national honors society, extracurriculars, got into college with a year of credits already. Then it's like my brain shut off. I had a shitty roommate who raped a girl and tried to blame it on me (I didn't even know her, had never even met her when it happened, and he told me he did it on the night he did it, but he stole my sweater and wore it when he raped her and for a while the cops believed him), and then it went downhill from there. I got worse and worse grades, lost track of whole days, stopped cleaning up after myself, lost friends, made enemies.  I barely graduated, and had to fight the school to let me graduate (we changed registration systems, and one asshole coach I took a required PE class from couldn't remember me taking his class and actually crossed out my fucking name and grade with a pen when the head of the PE department found my attendance records).  

I got diagnosed with depression somewhere in there.

Remembering names and dates gets harder and harder.  Remembering facts is even harder still. I told someone pi was 3.15 the other day. Making decisions takes forever.  I forget what I'm doing in the middle of doing it.   My reading comprehension is shot to shit.   I got a 740 in verbal on the SAT (and everyone and their fucking dog here is about to rub it in my face that they got an 800, so even that is going to make me look dumb), got 5's on the AP English and Spanish tests, was editor in chief of student newspapers ... now I'm reading, talking, and writing at maybe an eighth-grade level and I don't remember any Spanish. 

It's affecting my work too.  I got fired on Friday for being a dumb shit who couldn't do the job no matter how hard I tried.  And I TRIED, okay? I fucking TRIED. I put in my hours, I listened to feedback, I read the training materials, I asked for and got help, I was polite, I showed up early and stayed late, I was professional, I gave them hours for free that I DID work but wasn't fast or good enough ... and they fired me anyway, because I'm a dumbass who couldn't get it right despite all that. I didn't even last three weeks. That was the only job I've had since last year.

I can't afford a doctor.  I don't have insurance.  I'll be lucky if I'm not homeless at the end of the month.  That's why I'm asking here.  Does depression actually make you stupid?  If it does, then what can I do to stop it?  Like I said, I can't afford a doctor.  And from my experiences with doctors, unless there is a treatment that offers **GUARANTEED** and **FAST** and **CHEAP** results, it's not going to help me.

I've had twelve therapists, and all of them were absolute shit.  They never, never, never, never, **FUCKING NEVER AT ALL** listened to what I was saying.  Not a fucking one.  And it costs too goddamn much to go to a therapist for the minimum of 3 - 4 sessions (at $125 to $250 a pop if you're *lucky*) only to realize that they're yet another asshole who's wasting your time and money and won't listen or help.  I've tried medication, too.  Been on Prozac, Lexapro, Citalopram, Effexor, Cymbalta, Trazodone, Wellbutrin, something that starts with ""Villox,"" motherfucking Viibryd ... and that's just what I can remember.  None of it worked.  At best it made me fat and suicidal.  My one suicide attempt was on Lexapro.  Even after quitting, they've stuck around, mainly because I realized I was so fucking stupid I couldn't even figure out how to kill myself.  So I stopped taking them, and I've had to deal with so many goddamn withdrawal symptoms I am **NOT** about to take another addictive drug that some fucker is going to charge me $250 just to fucking prescribe unless I **KNOW** it will fucking **WORK** this time.

And if it's not depression that's making me stupider, then what is?  

**TL;DR** I know I'm getting stupider and stupider each fucking day.  I have depression and I want to know if that could be a cause, and what I can do to stop it (even if it's not fucking depression).  If there's a free **AND RELIABLE** IQ test online I could take, that would be good to know also.

She has had her ups and downs. Up until 2 years ago she seemed to have been getting a lot better. She was taking all of her medication, was sociable, overall she seemed very happy. I guess all of that mislead her into thinking she didn't need her medication anymore and we all know where that led to. Nowadays she is so far gone and lost in her own mind it's so sad. She is very paranoid that all of my family is out to get her and lock her up in a mental ward. This did happen once but it was because she heard voices taunting her and she threw a huge tantrum in her house and broke a window so the neighbors called the police and they had no choice but to take her away for 3 days. Anyways I heard that episodes of psychosis can cause brain damage and the longer the episodes the more damage there is to the brain. Now it has been almost 2 years since she relapsed and she is as bad as any schizophrenic person can get. She locks herself in her own room, talks to people who aren't there, her sentences barely make sense most of the time, she changes personalities often, and she doesn't trust anyone and refuses help. Since she is my cousin I have distanced myself from her because I feel extremely uncomfortable around her. However I can't imagine what my aunt and uncle are going through having to live her her 24/7. For those of you who have some experience with schizophrenics that have relapsed or stopped taking their meds for a while then began taking them again down the road, will they ever be the same or will their brain be too ""damaged"" for them to be anything like their old selves?

I'm not really sure how to go about this but I guess I'm here for a bit of advice, support, and just to rant a bit. I don't know the level of detail I should go into, I'll try not to over load things with unnecessary things. 

I'm a 24 year old male who's just moved home from University. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've suffered from ""depression"" since I was about 15 years old. I have seen many doctors, a few counsellors, and have been on about 4 different types of anti-depressant in that time. Things feel like they're getting worse. When something goes wrong I'm effected for longer. I feel like it should be noted as well, aside from an unrelated medical condition, I am healthy. I'm 175lbs, which is fine for 6'1"". I don't eat fast food often, I don't drink fizzy juice, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I drink every couple of weeks (Though this is something that varies with what kind of sad I'm feeling), I don't eat junk, and all my meals are properly cooked from healthy stuff. 
I added this bit cus I know a lifestyle change is often suggested, but I think that's probably the only thing I've got going for me.

I am currently seeing a new doctor who I feel is actually going to help me, I've seen him four times and he's not just thrown some medication at me. He's taken time to read over everything that's been kept about me, all the medications I've been on, and has set me up to meet a (in his words) ""mental health team"" to properly diagnose me, and so they can begin treatment and whatever. The problem I'm having is, it could be months before I'm seen by these people. Things are getting worse, and have been getting gradually worse for years. 

I'm 24 and I feel like I've accomplished nothing, because I haven't. The longer I wait, the longer it'll be before I can get STARTED on fixing myself, and then I need to build up to the point I should be at now. 
I managed to get about half way through my degree, I don't have an ordinary degree, let alone an honours, and that was five years. 

Another problem I have, which I have such a hard time explaining but I figure I'll try it here. So many people, even my current doctor, are just like, 
""Set yourself little goals and you'll be able to build yourself up""
But I can't do that. I know that sounds so defeatist, but I'll try and describe this as best I can. 
I have the motivation. I have the desire. I have the drive. It's just like there is this wall in the way, and I can't get past it. No matter how hard I try. 
My anxiety has grown and grown over the years to the point where it's almost paralysing now. Something ""weird"" (I don't know if it's actually weird, but my Stepmother suffers from severe anxiety and it's the complete opposite for her.) is that, the longer I'm awake the more capable I become. Though, the longer I'm awake the more prone I am to emotional breakdowns, over seemingly anything.
When I first wake up, that's when things are at there absolute worst for me. I don't even know why. I'm never thinking about anything, I just wake up and can't. 
Right now, it's 6am here in the UK and the only reason I can write this is because I've been awake so long. I woke up, and it took me hours to just turn the light on, let alone get out of bed (I can turn the light on in my bed). Any and all optimism I have before I go to sleep like, 
""Tomorrow is going to be different!""
Is completely gone when I wake up, and then that day is even harder. 
Even the things I'm meant to be able to do to relax and unwind, like play games, or read a comic book, or whatever. I just can't. 

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this sort of thing, but I just feel so lost. Each day that goes by, it feels like I'm getting further and further away from where I want to be. Even knowing that I am going to get help, and proper help, it could be actual months. I don't even know if I'll be alive then.

So I'd love any feedback. I'm 19 years old, my problem is I'm too nice to people... And I'm see myself continuously being used by others for their benefits. I buy into what people want me to do really easily, I find saying no and standing up for myself a real problem.. So there's some self confidence issue in there aswell. This is exactly what kind of personality characteristics my parents have... And it's becoming really hard for me to cope with it. I've been really bottling this up inside of me for quit some time now, and something happened in the past couple of days that isn't sitting well with me and is causing outburst of sadness, anxiety and I'm afraid I don't want any serious mental problems evolving out of this.

So I was in Halifax and essentially what happened is I got into a fight, and got the heck knocked out by a guy younger than me (I had been drinking prior to this event).. All my so called 'friends' were in the hotel with me at the time and decided that I was too drunk and told me to not come back until I'm sober.. I've been in 3-4 fights in my life (me getting punched, slapped etc) but I never fight back.. And I have no reason why... I'm fully capable of fighting back.. But I just fail so badly, and rather I start to cry (my mom is quite emotional aswell). Also, the thing is whenever I get into an argument with someone I always find myself unable to think on my feet.. I always see myself getting embarrassed in front of others and feeling bad about myself. 

This has really been a challenge for me.. I go to an Ivey league school and getting top-notch education.. However, I believe that my personality.. Lack of confidence is going to lead me nowhere in life.. And as for the toxic group of friends I have, won't be in touch with them for a long while..

My specialist dismissed these thoughts before and never wanted to talk about them. But this time she took it more seriously for some reason. Without talking to me, she locked me in a room and it wasn't opened until there were a couple big burly EMS attendants there to take me away to the hospital.

When I got there, I finally felt like someone was listening. The intake nurse did a great job of listening to me and validating my emotions of being in constant, chronic pain and medication changes.

I got transferred to a psychiatric facility, and was put in the severe psychosis ward! When I got there, I had 3 other room mates. One of them was a mother who just had a baby. She was very nice and... ""sane"" in comparison. I had another woman come in a few days later, and she would keep me up all night talking about how the devil is trying to rape her and because she is in the hospital he will rape us all. There was a woman there who would wake up at 4am and start moaning as loud as she could up and down the halls until lunch time. Everyone, including staff, wanted to give her a real reason to cry about. There was a man there who was so out of it, he would always go into my room. The first day he ate dinner in my bed and then pissed in it. I had to clean it up myself. I couldn;t sleep for the first two weeks at all and started hallucinating from lack of sleep. It wasn't until my SO came to yell at the duty doctor to let me come home and get rest for the night. They started giving me night passes at this point. 

Now let's get to my doctors. Firstly, the only time I saw a real doctor was 1 every 2 weeks. I was only able to deal with residents. Every day, the resident called me stupid. He made sure he knew how stupid I was because I chose to use cannabis instead of percs and oxy's and the like to control my pain. Secondly, the already made up their mind on the diagnosis before even getting the whole story. I would refuse to take the medication they wanted to force on me because I didn't think they were right. But there are no second opinions allowed in the hospital. So after my third week there I gave in and let them prick and prod me with their needles. The medication made me feel sick all the time. I barely remember what happened during that time I was on this medication. I was released on day 28. I kept taking the medication for a month longer before I started hallucinating again. I went to my doc and told me they had me on the max dose allowable, and that it was obviously too high for me.

Ever since that happened, I have been having nightmares nightly about being dragged away to the hospital and getting locked up. I went back to the hospital again for help and my experience was much nicer. I was diagnosed with PTSD at that point, but no one will admit that the hospital stay was the ""reason/stressor"" that got me so traumatically stressed in the first place.

There is nothing I can do. The hospital is a teaching hospital and the only one in my area that has a psych ward and ""community psychiatry"".

Has anyone else ever had such an experience before? I am terrified of having the same experience, but I am also terrified I might actually kill myself one of these days because I am still too scared to ask for help again after that. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,No one will admit it!

I'm a 20 year old college student and I don't know what's wrong or if there even is anything wrong with me. This is my second year at this university and it's not too bad, but for me personally it's become a hellhole. I'm transferring next semester but I need to make it through this one first, which is why I'm appealing to my fellow Redditors for help.

I used to be a really outgoing going guy (in high school and even here in college up until halfway through my first semester of my sophomore year). But something changed and I really don't have the slightest idea what it was. Towards the end of the fall semester this year I fell in love with a girl that I'm still with, though she no longer goes to my college. She's only a couple of hours away but she's getting her life together (a job, her own place) and the like. This mixed in with some other things lead us to come to the decision that now isn't the best time to be together. We still talk just about every day and she said she only has feelings for me so it's whatever for now. That's not why I'm here, though.

I'm here because I'm not the same outgoing, friendly person I once was but I know I should be. I've always been a little bit introverted but now I'm down to a couple of good friends that I hang with occasionally, and when I'm not doing schoolwork(which I usually do at the library because I can't focus in my house that I share with my housemates) I'm on my laptop doing interweb things. Which is fine with me, I've always been a tech person. . .I'm getting off track.

I have developed anxiety issues and I don't know why. But I do know that my housemates don't mess(talk) with me anymore and whatever the reason is, it's effecting me. I've overheard them say some pretty nasty things about me, and when I'm chilling up in my room(I no longer hang with them downstairs) I hear voices that sound like theirs and other company that they/we have over trash talking me as well. Calling me creepy, weird, sketchy, tweaky, etc. It hurts because we moved into this house together because we were all pretty good friends last year, though I'm a year younger. And while some of the voices I hear aren't confirmed to be real, the rumors and lies that they have been spreading about me on campus are. People that I've known for a while, that I used to hang and party with call me weird now and as I said earlier I'm down to a couple of good friends that I know I can trust.

Whenever I go home to visit my family I feel perfectly fine and normal. But as soon as I get back here I just don't feel the same way. Even when I'm in class now I think that when people are whispering behind or beside me that they are talking about me.(And sometimes they might actually be, because I zone out some times and twitch occasionally.) 

I realize that it's irrational and selfish to think that people spend so much of their time critiquing me when they have their own problems to worry about, but this doesn't stop me from having these severe anxiety issues. I've always been a believer of God and I try to live my life carefree and happy, but lately I've been having trouble doing so. I don't even smoke weed anymore because it increases my paranoia.

She stayed in a motel that night. She is also under the belief that the city is selling her house without her permission.

There is no indication that she is in any sort of legal or civil trouble with anyone, and I've checked with city hall and the local PD to ensure that none of the things she is claiming are true in the least.

Until this conversation, the night before last, I had no idea my mother was suffering these concerns. Last night I managed to get her to stay at her home but she refused to sleep in her bed due to the belief that there were cameras fixed in her bedroom. 

Today she arrived at my apartment in her car, intent upon taking me, leaving town and heading across state lines. When I asked her why, she told me she thought I was in danger, and refused to tell me from what. I took her car keys away from her and got her brother to come and drive her home. 

She refuses to listen to our suggestions, commands, and finally pleas that she visit a doctor and explain the stresses to them, insisting she is fine until simply shutting down and becoming unresponsive.

Her situation is degrading and she needs to be under medical care but we cannot get her to accept this. So far she is not a physical danger to herself or others, but her intention to leave town scared me. I still have her car keys and I just left her at her home, curled up in blankets on the floor in her living room.

I've been seeing a therapist for about the last three months for DBT/psychoanalysis. He's the first therapist that I've ever actually connected with (besides my very first kiddie therapist), and he is fucking hilarious. I always leave smiling or laughing. I've been having trouble paying him for the last few weeks because of my job (I get a stipend, and it's... very tiny. Barely enough for my rent and bills) and it's really been worrying me. I worry about money as it is, and owing people money makes me SUPER anxious. I was certain that he was mad at me or resentful or frustrated. It led to several very upset nights on the phone with my parents, trying to figure out how I can stretch the little money I have. 

On Monday night I was supposed to start DBT skills group, but as I got there and people started coming in, I began getting incredibly anxious. My leg started bouncing and I was just getting upset. I couldn't breath, my vision was blurring and the temperature skyrocketed. As we all moved into the office, it because too much and I darted back out of the room, to the bathroom. I locked myself in a stall and had my first ever full on panic attack. It was terrifying. As I started calming down from the panic, shame and embarrassment set in, and I couldn't face the group. I ended up staying in the bathroom for about 30 minutes before moving to the outer office area while I waited for the group to finish so I could get my things. I was crying, ashamed, frustrated at myself and just angry at the situation. I texted my therapist and told him to cancel my appointments and that I wouldn't be doing group. 

He replied and we had a text-based conversation in which he assured me that he wasn't mad, wasn't upset with me, and asked me to please reconsider walking away from therapy. I did and went to therapy today. I am so glad that I did. He talked me through Monday night and reminded me that I'm not alone - most of the other participants have had anxiety attacks, and they were all just worried about me, rather than judging me. 

But here's the part I really want to share: I confided in my therapist that I was feeling incredibly guilty about owing him money. He's been saying that sessions are pro-bono until I have some money, but in my head I was convinced that he was just saying that and was, in reality, incredibly upset with me for not being able to pay him. He sat me down and explained that pro-bono means pro-bono. To stop worrying about those sessions. We're waiting on reimbursement from my insurance company, and as soon as that comes in, we'll be even. I wanted to hug him. I just needed to hear him tell me that, and he read me and knew that's what I needed. THAT is an amazing therapist.

Lately things have been better. I have a job and functioning somewhat. Don't have any friends or any purpose in life but I work hard for my pathetic minimum wage job and take pride in doing my best at it, It keeps me busy and gives me something to do. I am lost on my days off when I don't have work to structure my day around. Anyways I had previouslly dropped out of college and wanted to see if I could salvage the wasted years, all the terrible experiences, and thousands of dollars in debt but I have no idea what my options at going back to school are. Before I did that I would want to try and see a psychiatrist but don't have the money. I used to see a psycologist who really didn't do anything other than put me into financial problems but she functioned as a person I could ask general knowledge questions too. I don't have any friends, peers, family to ask things. I would need healthcare to see a psychiatrist but I can't figure out my healthcare stuff. 

So I was just wondering if there are resources that help people with mental illnesses trying to function in society. I am not really able to call up people or set appointments and do things myself really. I have had bad experiences with people most of my life and afraid of most people. The type of people I need to talk to are the ones that deal with maybe hundreds of people a day, they hate their work, don't care, impatient, lack any compassion and empathy for others. Some seem to pity me but most just get annoyed or disgusted when I can barely breathe or am sweating profusely from anxiety and things always go bad. 

So is there anything out there that helps people get set up with healthcare, school, work, stuff like that? I am just really scared and don't think I can do this on my own. I want to try and better my life but have no idea how to do it. Also would like someone who is unbiased and that I don't have to pay a hundred dollars an hour to. I am really impressionable and easily talked into doing stupid things. This made school hell but then when I became an adult and I was even doing good my mom pressured me into going back to school. I had to quit my good job then it was just a terrible experience and set me back a few years. I was unemployed and depressed for a year after dropping out. I don't really want to go back to school since I hated it and the evil people I encountered there but just want to see what my options are. if there is anyway to salvage the wasted years and thousands of dollars in debt, I want to find out.

Since last night my mum has been acting strangely; I first saw her downstairs looking for my aunt, who wasn't there, nor expected to be. She then proceeds to spend the rest of the day talking and arguing loudly, imagining that my aunt and my dad's co-worker are there and that they're talking and laughing at her.

Although it's not necessarily out of character for her to be an attention seeker - and I think that this apparent illness may be exacerbated by this - it is likely that it could have been caused due to a 8-9 year alcohol addiction. Recently, she has been taking medication to help with the addiction, but I don't think that she takes it all that seriously.

Her general disposition isn't all that different from drunk, so I think that she has probably been drinking. She's arguing with these imaginary people as if they've also been drinking, telling them that they're causing a fuss and that they need to go home. This tends to get louder and more physical the longer it has been since someone has tried to get her to stop; she starts banging things, walking around, and eventually starts messing around with the windows and front door, which make a lot more noise. When I try to tell her to stop, she acts as if they're actually somehow present, and that they won't leave her alone. When I try to tell her that she doesn't need to shout and that it's all in her head, she just blanks me and carries on arguing.

For whatever reason this is going on for, the noise and disruption is going to take it's toll on my family, as it's stressful and impossible to sleep.

I'm not really sure why I started writing this post. This must be the third or fourth rewrite- it's just so hard to express exactly what I mean. I guess it makes me feel connected, and gives me a chance to feel validated, or get support. I've never posted here, and I don't know how y'all respond to self-post rambles like these- I don't see much of this stuff in the top posts- But I hope it's not banal and annoyingly common for you all, and that if someone takes the time to read it maybe they'll understand what I mean- maybe give me their input. Thanks.

I guess the closest I've found for a description of what I've dealt with, these last several years, is Bipolar II disorder. If you're unfamiliar with it, think regular bipolar disorder where the mania isn't outright dysfunctional. Instead, I get periods of hypomania- all of the levity and energy and motivation of mania, without the paranoia, insomnia, and truly extreme characteristics it can have. Those periods are excellent. I'm funny and empathetic and productive and fun when I'm hypomanic. Honestly, I love the feeling. But, such as the disorder works, the feeling never lasts.

The subject of this post is, I guess, a particular sensation I get when I'm coming off a hypomanic period, right as I'm moving back towards depression. It's a moment of recognition of the futility of it all, and it's probably the most devastatingly helpless I've ever felt about my mental health. I experienced it today, and it was strong enough to bring me as close to the edge of breakdown I've ever been, and it was overwhelming enough that I felt like I had to do SOMETHING to get it out. So I suppose that's what this post is.

Perhaps important to this is the nature of my depressive states. I've never really had a major depressive period I can remember- or at least nothing like the descriptions of totally debilitating Major Depressive disorders I've read so often in trying to get a handle on my issues. A lot of the time I'm just... flat. I can't bring myself to get excited about much of anything, and I'm so far from motivated my mother has said, maybe amusingly, that she'd suspect I was a total stoner if she didn't think she'd been around enough of them to know the smell and the other signs...


But, of course, it's not just that. There's always this sense of... negativity. Maybe the apathy is just an element of my self-loathing- a ""why try?"" complex, or something to that effect. When on a downswing, I live with constant insecurity- with a sense of being worthless and lazy and, well, *unloveable* that can't be penetrated by even direct statements to the contrary (And of course there's an unfulfilled love interest here. Oh to be a teenager is to live a cliche...). It's difficult, yes. But so is everything, really. It's manageable. I live on- I'm lucky enough to be left uncrippled by my  depression. I can still take care of myself, I can get out of bed in the mornings, still laugh and get passionate about things and love and feel like I enjoy myself. I'm not, thank god, living the hell that some do.
 

Maybe I deserve a kick in the teeth for taking so long to get to the point, and maybe the explanation doesn't help that much, but writing it down and trying to explain it is in a way cathartic, and I'm not sure I can describe the feeling on its own well enough for it to be understood, without background.

It's a sense of being... exhausted. Fed up. Frustrated. Just so *done* with feeling unwell. Tired, really, of knowing that the good feelings just can't last, and that even if I get to have a whole week in the sun, sooner or later I'll get dragged back into that self-destructive darkness, and that my recent wellness will make all my dysfunction feel as infuriating and debilitating as it ever has. I feel so trapped. After three or four successful, happy, *good* days, feeling myself sliding back into depression, knowing that all the things I love most in life are losing their brightness and edge... it's awful, and hopeless, and positively maddening.

But more than that, it's knowing that with my mania leaves the person I want to be. I'm disgusted with the person I am when I'm depressed. I'm apathetic and lazy and self-destructive- It's not that I blame myself for being sad, it's that having so recently felt what it's like to be happy and well and right, watching all of that just ebb away is so damned frustrating.

When I'm depressed, I'm not me. 
When I'm happy and well, I feel like the person I *should be,* the person I *could be,* and getting to feel like that- to *be that person* for a few days only to have it ripped away time and time again... it makes me want to scream and rage against the bullshit world that would give me the ""potential"" and ""gifts"" that have my whole life been shoved in my face and treated like a debt owed to the world- a responsibility to study hard and do great things with my life... and then take from me the ability to feel normal or truly, unfetteredly happy for more than a couple days at a time.

God, I'm so tired of it.

Does anyone know this feeling well? How do you deal with the knowledge that, short of medicine and/or therapy you don't have access to, no matter how far you get above the water, no matter how long you stay up, you'll always be pulled back down?

On mobile, it's impossible to tell how long this will look on the normal layout, but I've the feeling that it's terribly overlong for something not really that complicated. Sorry for the wall of text, I suppose, but this was the best place I could think to vent and maybe get some advice.

Thanks again,

With that said, I have mentioned these fears with my therapist but have been wondering how I would perform such a balancing act so that I can get help but not risk my future? And how long does it typically take for a therapist to make a decision as to what 'illness' someone has? That is, at what point is the point of no return, where I'd basically be fucked and not be able to turn back without having these things on my med record.

I ask because I hope to one day work for public services, and recently I have been doing quite poorly in school as I never was good at school, but I'm really taking hits to my academic record at my university. Thus, I have been considering that if I'm asked to withdraw from school that I may join the military as I had initially planned before I was unexpectedly accepted into a university. I have all tests (medical, physical, mental) completed and was cleared, I just never signed a contract. I was told I may return within two years and sign just like that.

And I know many would say that with my history it may be irresponsible to enter such a field, however I truly do not believe I have any mental illness. I think I just have issues (like everybody does) that I need to work through before I fix some problems I've been having. I also understand that there is the common belief that if you are already having problems (mentally) that you are not suited for work in the military. Though I merely would say that I don't think that is a fair judgment because the area I grew up in (south central L.A) has regular shootings/gang activity and so I'm not sensitive to that kind of thing. In fact shootings are so common in the neighborhood I grew up in, that people don't even bother to 'duck and cover' if it isn't happening on their street. My father was nearly murdered when I was in highschool and my cousin was shot in a drive by shooting along with various other run ins with local gangs and near death tragedies, so it would suffice to say I am no stranger to violence. I am also in good shape and can complete any physical task that may be required of me. I can do a good number of push-ups (55), and decent pull-ups (12) and can do my mile good and easy. I guess I'm just trying to say that I feel I should be eligible but am torn because therapy can potentially ruin my career choices, but I have been feeling that I've been making progress after just three sessions.

Furthermore, with this in mind these are my questions.


**How long do therapists take to 'diagnose' patients?**



**Can I ask if I have been diagnosed, and if so is there any way to contest it?**



**Should I ask my therapist if i can switch to one of the other b.s programs like 'couples/relationship' counseling so I may remain without diagnosis and she could still get paid by insurance?**",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,How do I balance my desire to get better with my need to not be diagnosed?

 Is it normal for someone to hear their own voice screaming at them that they are ugly, worthless, useless, wastes of space? I've been self-harming and have been suicidal for years but lately it feels like pain is all I deserve, that I should take another overdose. I can't be alone anymore, I get paranoid, feel like I'm being watched and when I'm in public it feels like everywhere I go people are watching me, and that they know I have these thoughts in my head and that they're judging me. I can't eat anymore, I can't sleep. I was diagnosed with depression before but I never felt this bad before. I don't want to spend my days trying not to cry anymore. I want to be able look at myself without feeling like I'm worthless, like something is really wrong with me. I know this probably doesnt sound as bad as I think it is but I really do feel like I'm losing it. My last breakdown nearly killed me, and the one 2 years before left me with scars that won't heal properly. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Please help. Any advice/opinion/anything.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,UPDATE: I(24F) feel like I'm loading my mind!

The reason is my depression got really worse recently and had a lot of anxiety with it so I finally made an appointment hopped on the wellbutrin and started therapy. I'm not sure if it is working but here is what I'm experiencing and not sure if it is normal. I'm gonna keep a live journal here of everything I feel:

Day 1: Overall everything just felt better by night and even saw a boost in mood

Day 2: Felt good in the morning had a therapy session then by night I felt a bit stressed

Day 3: Feel very stressed out and like I'm back to where I was with the depression and anxiety

Day 4: Woke up pretty stressed and depressed. Almost as if I were going through a breakup. Not totally sure what's causing the anxiety but just took the 4th dose. Hopefully that helps. I do know that some of the things I feel are not normal and I need to fix it so I just have to remind myself it might take time to adjust. Later my emotions were all over the place when it got later at night. I even started being a bit of a jerk to my SO (I'm normally very sweet so this is out of character). 

Day 5: So far I feel sorta numb. And my negativity is back. Not sure why but hopefully it will adjust and lessen throughout the day but I'm worried it's taking a toll on my SO. Just finishing up the day and having a lot of fluctuations in emotions but a lot of episodes of panic and then very rare moments of calm.  

Not sure if this is all normal and that maybe I just had a good day on Day 1 and it wasn't the drug. Anyone know if this is normal?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,First few days on Wellbutrin

Well, over the past few weeks I have been slowly begun to feel the I'm getting more and more unstable. I eat less, but not because I don't like food or anything, it just doesn't register in my mind that I'm getting hungry. I have violent mood swings and they often subside seconds after I have them. I really don't feel connected to anything or anyone, this always used to happen to me though. Like I can empathize with anyone, but I can also just completely disconnect myself from them immediately. I'm not going to deny the fact that I do drugs, some of them with a high potential for getting addicted to, but because of my ability to completely disconnect myself from things at my will, I don't really have a problem. Also, earlier I used to be content with the fact that I knew how to make pyrotechnics that could potentially harm people or cook up stimulants, but recently I've been getting these urges to cook something up and see what happens. 
Oh and also, I cant sleep at night, not that I've tried, I fall asleep randomly throughout the day, and when I take 7-8 pills of 25mg diphenahydramine I sleep for an hour or two. Currently, I'm in my 96th hour of being awake, although I have fallen asleep randomly for a minute or two. I've been getting weird but believable hallucinations for sometime now which makes me all the more doubtful of whether I'm asleep or not. 
I'm resorting to Yahoo!Answers because I don't really want my parents to worry about nothing, neither do I want to go to a therapist. Anyways, I really must thank you for your answers as I bid you goodbye for tonight.

I can go from happy to very depressed (in the normal sense of the word, not in the mental condition sense) in under 10 seconds, reacting to an external or internal stimulus.

She was horrible to me--she told me she wouldn't bring my mom into sessions with me until I told her it was okay, and then a couple weeks later she did just that. That session consisted of both of them scolding/shaming me for my ""negative mindset,"" and after that I stopped seeing her. I felt too unsafe and I couldn't really trust her much afterwards.

I know I need to see somebody for my own good, and I know that I shouldn't be terrified just because  I had one bad experience. I had an appointment to see a different therapist a few weeks ago, but 2 days before the appointment I made my parents cancel because I was too anxious/scared/afraid to go. I can't seem to find any therapist that I'm *not* afraid of seeing. 

I also have such a wide range of symptoms (to the point where it's possibly indicative of multiple problems, not just one) that I don't know what to look for in a therapist. All the therapists/psychiatrists nearby seem to have certain specializations and I'm worried that with such specific specializations, I might pick someone who wouldn't be able to see everything that I've got going on. I don't really know whether I should look for psychiatrists, therapists, etc. as in: who would be giving me the diagnosis, who would be giving me medication, so on and so forth

I want to be able to know what's wrong before I go to college this fall (last time, I never got a diagnosis? I don't think I saw her long enough for her to make one) so I can adjust before I go to college. I figure that it'd be one less thing to worry about when I get there... but I think it would also open up a lot more resources for me and it might make the process easier. 

My mom's stance is ""food is medicine,"" is convinced that my problems could be fixed with a dietary change, etc. and prefers to look for mental health professionals that wouldn't prescribe me medication. I would prefer to go the more usual route of being evaluated, getting therapy, taking medication if necessary, and trying alternative methods if that doesn't work out. I don't know if it'd be wiser of me to seek help now/ASAP so that I wouldn't have to suffer as long (I've already waited a long time because I've been so wishy-washy) or if I should just wait until I don't have to conflict as much with my mother.

So I guess my questions are:

1. How should I keep myself from being scared away from therapy? 
2. What should I be looking for when I look for somebody to see, and what type of mental health professional am I supposed to see first?
3. Should I do this now, or wait a few months until I move in at college?

Put simply, I'm 17 and from the UK. I feel as if life isn't worth living, therefore often contemplate suicide. This isn't because of physical or emotional pain. I just simply lack the will to live. 

Through the ages of 13-14 I was relentlessly verbally abused for my desire to play video games, I literally played for hours on end. I remember often that after being called names, for example, 'keen' or 'no life', that I'd feel an emotional pain. I felt as if the people that were calling me these names were really out to get me, as if they wanted me dead. After a while, I've no idea when, that emotional turmoil stopped. I simply didn't give a shit (pardon my French).

I don't know how you may have interpreted that last paragraph, some may see it as a benefit whilst others a curse (as I have realised). If you have inferred something along the lines of 'He doesn't care what the bullies think, great' you're partly right, however it hasn't benefited me in the slightest.

If you know anything about the UK eduction system, you'll know that by now I would have sat my GCSE's, well, obviously I did. Of the 12 I sat I passed 5. Despite it being drilled into my head that these were some of the most important exams of my life, I didn't care, I lacked the motivation to revise for every single exam I took. I did nothing, I sat and watched as some classmates revised for hours on end, week in, week out. I remember my mother crying as she drove me home from results day, as I failed to meet the requirements for sixth form, for those not from the UK, it's further education. Where UK children take their AS and A levels before going to university. Back on topic, it didn't phase me at all. I was sat next to my mother, who was in tears, crying because I failed and had nowhere to go, I knew this myself but simply sat back as if nothing happened. I had accepted failure, but wasn't unsatisfied with it.

Alongside my inability to care, I have also developed a lack of self worth. I steer clear of social media sites like Twitter, which the majority of my friends use. Why you ask? I simply don't believe anyone would care about anything I had to say, about any topic, be it politics, religion or what someone had for breakfast. The same goes for other social media sites, I don't use a single one. The same principle applies to my phone, despite having my friends phone numbers, I never call or text any of them. Simply because I feel I would be annoying them by doing so. As a result I have my parents paying £32 a month for a phone that is never used. 

This in itself has resulted in myself having multiple personalities, I also feel at times I may be bipolar, whilst during the day, around people I'm happy and interact normally to social situations. I'm basically trying to say I'm normal, however when I try to sleep, when life catches up with me, I reminisce and 99.9% of the time I find myself angry and occasionally contemplating suicide. I feel the past makes me angry because it was a better time, but I can't have it back. Obviously as it has been and gone.

Fast forward a year and you have me here, before you, typing this. To be brutally honest I don't know why, I can't imagine any of you caring - but that doesn't bother me. I guess what I really would like to know is, is it possible to change my mindset? Before I really do destroy my life with some incident that could be easily avoided. 

Thank you for your time, especially if you read the entire post.

Usually I have to miss my first period class the next morning because I'm so stressed out about falling asleep on time vs. the fear that I end up not being able to fall asleep. It also causes horrible and intense sobbing. It's starting to affect my life in other areas, mainly stressing my relationship with my SO and my school life.

So he decided to take me to my primary care physician for a checkup, figured it was something to do with my physical being. My dad not having much experience with mental health and all. Saw the doctor, gave him the whole explanation of the lack of being able to go to sleep and stay asleep and that I felt anxious about almost everything.

Skip ahead a few weeks and I'm seeing a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist says I need to get some meds to get back into the swing of things. Then for some reason she hands me off to somebody with the title ""Registered Nurse.""

When that didn't help me stay asleep she prescribes an anti-depressant. And when that doesn't work, a bigger dose of the sleep med.


I felt hopeless, alone, afraid, stupid, unwanted, unloved, and even suicidal for a bit. I couldn't go to school because I felt I was constantly judged, I was the infamous truant de etat. After being out of high school for months my dad and I decide on sending me to a private boarding school. That dealt with somewhat ""similar"" teenagers. The school was based out of Utah, so I moved. At the time, I didn't know how long I'd be away from home. I was told the program was about 10 months long but some kids stayed there for years. I would go to school, church, and participate in therapy while I was there. Basically have a routine which I hated at the time.

So I went through the motions. I had a therapist, had a rough time trying to fit in, worked my ass off in school, did A LOT of catch up work and graduated from high school from there after about a year. Ecstatic to be able to not see West Ridge Academy ever again, I went home.

And boy did I struggle, I had no direction, no motives, no goals, and certainly no plans for school.

**START HERE IF YOU HATE NOVELS**

About 2 months ago I scheduled a meeting with a new doctor, namely a psychiatrist. (my old ones moved while I was M.I.A.) Not gonna lie, I felt pretty pumped to have a fresh start, to express why I didn't need/want to have the sleeping pills, anti-depressants, and anti anxiety meds in my life. Nothing was gonna stand in my way after dealing with a stalemate/limbo on my mental health. 

After expressing my thoughts I was prescribed a new medication and was met with some positive reinforcement that I needed to still have these meds. Now I'm not one to argue with a seasoned health care professional so I took the punch. 

What do I do? Is this gonna forever? (my name is David, David after Dentist joke) Do I go at it again? I'm just tired of feeling dependent, I'm tired of feeling the same as I did at the start. Thanks for sticking around. This really helped me by just writing out all of this.

Prior to that, while having been misdiagnosed as ADHD, I took amphetamines every day for four years.

Towards the end of the binge ( at 16 the binge lasted for 6 months), I began to develop a psychosis that was me hallucinating incontinence. Once I quit, this somewhat disappeared; were I to have a panic attack, urinary incontinence hallucinations reared their ugly head. So real so vivid... but false.

Now, it's been almost four years. I touched meth here and there, but never binged or really dosed past the first dose. These weren't hallucinations I could ignore; I was convinced. They were also delusions.

Approx. six months ago, I met a stranger and ended up smoking meth. I cannot control myself around a pipe (usually, just pipes); as much as it was offered, I took.

The person I was with was and is very psychopathic; my torture was his amusement. He actually ended up literally pulling shit out of my ass, because at some point *I did* begin to shit.

I won't get into detail, but it seems eating, drinking, or finding something else to concentrate on sometimes helps me ignore it. The two times it actually happened, I was withdrawing on heroin; the third time it may somewhat have happened, I was on heroin that was less strong.

Now, up until today, I thought downers were the answer. I wouldn't hallucinate whatsoever; I wouldn't even be distraught. Anxiety and panic had a role in the hallucinations.

But I never could figure out what caused it when it actually happened; and since I had evidence of it happening at least twice, who's to say it hasn't actually happened before but people were too... in need of ignoring the situation to not only not tell me, but to mostly ignore it themselves? I have heard that there are laxatives in meth, as of course it isn't pure; I also have realized that the less I do, the less likely the psychosis is.

Also, I wonder what trauma, if any, could cause this? I have a lot missing from my mind when I was a meth addict at 16; my fiance-at-the-time has tried to convince me that I had sex with two people I have no memory of having sex with. One of those people obviously wanted me for himself based on quite a few of his actions , words, and initial claims he'd only take sexual acts as payment for drugs (eventually he, my fiance-at-the-time, and me would just do the drugs for free, because I'm not a whore).

I also have MRKH syndrome, and I often wonder if the nerves in my back are connected correctly because I'll lose some feeling below the waist unless I sit with my back totally straight.

I spoke to my therapist and told him about this, because even when sober this haunts me. He believes I was anally raped when I was young. I wonder if I wasn't anally raped while off my rocker on meth part of the way through my binge...

Someone else has told me it's because of low levels of dopamine, and that many females experience such when coming down. For most of my amphetamine career *I had no comedown and couldn't relate to those who did*.

As one last note, this doesn't feel like a shart or whatever; it feels as if my asshole is leaking shit constantly, not that there was a momentary relaxation resulting in shit covering everything. There are odd moments when it defies gravity and is upon mid-buttcheek...

Please; this is the torment of my life since I first experienced it. My problem is that it could mean something VERY wrong with my body being intercepted (can't think of the word) by my brain.

More intense, and much more frequent as days pass. Rumination seems to be the main cause of it, and today I had my boss living in my head rent free for the better half of my shift because of  something I messed up on the day before. All the while I am questioning my own competency and judgement. Only at the end of my shift did I deduce that it all should have been water off of my back and a simple explanation of why I did what I did. 

Another thing I have going on is, I have very disturbing intrusive thoughts that come in on a somewhat regular basis. The most disturbing one is, I think about my best friends daughter and she is 3. Now, I'm not going on ToR and trying to fantasize or live out similar thoughts or ideas, but they do frighten me. After these thoughts, I am questioning myself with whether or not I am insane or if it is within the scope of what normal can sometimes be. I've always seen myself as eccentric, but this fad of intrusive thought leads me to believe I might be psychotic.

So now I am debating about whether or not I should read the DSM 5 so I have an idea of what to toe when I see a head doctor or if I should just tell them the truth of how I feel and what I think about and to just accept the possibility of being adjudicated mentally defective.  

I have had a history of seeing shrinks growing up, (I think most of it was due to ADHD) but I also wonder sometimes if my parents thought I was actually crazy. Should I ask my parents about what they thought when I was younger? If they thought I was actually crazy and they hoped that I just grew out of it? Should I go and see a counselor what I am thinking about and see about my anxiety, or is this just what other normal people deal with on a daily basis? Am I normal?

I thought the people on this sub might find it helpful.



For me it was a combination of medication to make the urges more manageable and treating the compulsions like an addiction.

The more you get involved in them the deeper you get drawn in, and the further your perspective shifts from reality. Feed the addiction by giving in to the compulsions and you not only suffer now, but you reinforce the habit and your mind works harder to create the next compulsion. The deeper you go, the more severe and delusional your fears will be.

On the flip side, resist the urge and eventually they get weaker as your mind begins to choose reality over delusional fear. This takes time though, the next immediate one may well be stronger as your anxiety resists the change.

When it comes to making that initial change, for me it was a case of being sick of the compulsions and realising the fears are endless. When your perception of reality is warped you probably won't be convinced that pulling yourself away from the fixation is the right thing to do. I still have issues convincing myself of this. But you need to realise that if you continue down the path of addiction it will only get worse and never end. Thinking ""just this last one and things will be fine"" is a complete falsehood. You need to realise that you are creating the fears, not just reacting to them.

Like I said, if things are bad you may not believe this. In this case take an impartial look at your experience. Every time it was supposed to be ""the last one"" was it actually? No. Do you hate being trapped like this? Yes. What will happen if you stop? You don't know. So there is no evidence to suggest things will get better by continuing to give in. You don't know what will happen if you resist, but there is no evidence that things will get worse. For all you know it might bring about the end of the world, but that is unfounded. And it is the only way things could possibly improve. It's a risk, but don't you deserve that chance? Let go of the fear, throw caution to the wind, and leap. If you really want to change it's the only way.

The best bit is what comes next. The world doesn't end. All of a sudden your fear is debunked, you no longer feel scared of it, and you have positive evidence that things get better when you resist. From there you build your confidence and climb out of that hole. Eventually it becomes instinctive and you subconsciously block the fears out.

If things are so bad you can't think at all, just take it from a veteran that the best thing to do is prioritise yourself first because your fears are unfounded. Use breathing to calm yourself down, take some medication if you have some for emergencies, and just nurture the scared child inside you until your head clears.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Some advice for OCD sufferers from a veteran

I just don't know what kind or how or who to contact or how to ask for this help. I think I'm completely emotionally closed off from everyone around me, I've locked everything inside to the point that it's unhealthy and affects my life. In my past I went through a very toxic and unhealthy upbringing, my parents were abusive towards one another and I think I may have suffered emotional abuse from my mother, though I'm not sure when the line draws and it becomes abuse. My brothers were bullies and I stopped speaking to them 10 years ago, when I was 12, and don't speak to them to this day.

Despite this, I wasn't always emotionally closed off. In high school I had a group of friends I really loved and would turn to when I was having issues at home. I had one best friend in particular who I loved more than anything. Her and her family was the one thing I had to turn to, I always went to her when I wanted to talk about my feelings. However our friendship started to have conflicts, coming from her, and one day she finally confessed that she didn't like hearing about my issues, that she never felt sorry for me and that she though I was whining and that listening to my problems was too overwhelming. This was devastating for me to hear, as I had been turning to her for years. After this she kept cutting me out of her life and taking me back again. Until one day she just stopped answering my texts or messages. She never gave any kind of warning or told me she didn't want to speak to me, she just ignored the attempts I made to contact her, and I haven't spoken to her in almost 2 years now. I still think about her and feel pain over losing her. I had another best friend who was friends with us both as the entire situation was going on, and she was often stuck in the middle. She came to visit one summer, got angry at me and went home without ever speaking to me again. My third best friend I met in college, and I'm pretty sure my friendship with him was abusive. He made me feel terrible about myself, saying things he knew would hurt my feelings, and I was the only person he treated this way. He could be very, very mean. He would brush it off saying he was ""just joking"" and since he was nice to our other friends, they all assumed I was just making a big deal out of nothing. I felt like the reason he was mean to me was because I deserved it, and just needed to be a less annoying/stupid/worthless person in order to deserve nice treatment from him. This friendship went on for 2 years, and ended when he pretty much exploded one day. I'm pretty sure he had tons of issues which caused him to be such an abusive asshole in the first place, and probably at the bottom of how he dumped me. Me and him had agreed to be roommates and were going to move into an apartment. I got a text from him one day saying that I wasn't welcome to live there anymore and I was kicked out. (This was after we had already put down our deposit and everything.) Turns out he had gone to the office and told the managers lies about me to get them to take me off the lease. It didn't work, since you can't take someone else off a lease, so he went crazy, sending me 5-6 page long texts about everything that was wrong with me, and how he couldn't stand the sight or thought of me would apparently do something horrible if he saw me, and telling constant lies about what he had really said/done to the managers. This went on for a week, and in the end the managers offered me another apartment and I moved into that one by myself. After this the friend began telling more lies about what had happened to our mutual friends, saying that the reason I didn't live with him was because I didn't have a cosigner or other random lies to cover anything bad he had done. We were never friends again after that, which was probably for the best but was still and extremely painful thing to go through.

I guess the result of this is that I haven't been able to have a good relationship since this all happened. It's been 1-2 years since I've had any contact with any of these past best friends, and the loss of each one was another blow to my sense of self-worth. I haven't been able to truly connect with someone since these things happened. The idea of sharing any pain or personal feelings with someone just brings back horrible memories of losing my first best friend, and I can't help but think that sharing these things with people will drive them away or hurt them. I have friendships, but they are only on the surface and they don't know much about my personal life. In their presence I am happy and fun, but if I were going through any pain I would hide it from them at all costs. Due to this I don't feel like I've been able to really connect with someone since these things happened. I feel lonely often, but have also gotten so used to being closed off that I don't know how to open up again.

I feel like my depression is under control, it doesn't affect me to the point it did when I went to the clinic, so I don't know if this kind of thing would apply. I just want to connect to people and get over all the fear and self-hatred that all these failed friendships have left me with. But I don't know where to go or how to start.

I need a bit of help.

My best friend has crazy delusions about everything.  For example:

* 9/11 was an inside job
* There's a black pope that runs the world
* The illuminati control everything
* Vaccines spread illness and are responsible for autism and asthma
* All scientific studies are lies
* Everybody is trying to kill us using pesticides and population control
* AIDS and most diseases are man-made to reduce the population
* Evolution is a plot to get everybody to convert to atheism

I could literally go on for hours about the different crazy delusions he believes.  It's VERY worrying for me, because he's my best friend.

I'm wondering a bunch of things - first, based on these types of crazy beliefs, what type of mental illness does he suffer from? Mental illness does run in his family, and his mother may be schizophrenic.  Second, how can I get him help?  Is there any way of making him see that these are all symptoms of a mental illness? That no reasonable person can believe what he believes?

Okay, so I've reached a point where I just need to let it out. Sorry if this turns into a wall of text. I'm on my phone. 



Since this is for mental health and related to mental health issues, despite how convoluted my rant may be. 



I would like to preface this by saying I was diagnosed with depression (I went in for ADD, and came out with depression, lol) and ADD. My wife is bi-polar and has ADD as well. Both of us are not taking any medication at this time. 



So, my wife and I have been having problems. We have a daughter coming  in 6 days. My first, her third. 



We see each other on the weekends since I live in another state throughout the week for work. 



She... Is constantly mad at me for various reasons. This started before she got pregnant. Our main reason for argument at the moment that she is fixated on is the fact that I ""don't care about anything"". 



I do. I care about her, our kids, and our baby. I want her happy, and I want to provide for them the best I can. 



What she means is that she has no leverage against me. In that she gets upset if I don't feel like driving the 4.5 hours one weekend due to exhaustion from work. 



Whereas I wouldn't mind or in her words ""care"" if she felt the same. I don't mind if she doesn't want to talk, or if she wants to watch something rather than talk to me throughout the week.



I'm perfectly fine with that. But if I hint at me not feeling up to coming, or want to go to bed, or unwind with whatever. 



Our latest argument stemmed from the fact that she requested I abstain from alcohol for the duration of the pregnancy in support of her. 



I had no problem, and for the most part, followed that promise. I did break it a few times in the later months, mainly because I've been extremely stressed with work and broke down and bought a six pack.



I'm now being accused of not caring if she is happy or not since the few times I did have a drink apparently cancel out everything I've done to make her happy and have a better life. 



I told her I was a grown adult and should be able to ingest what I want as long as it doesn't hurt myself or anyone else. (1 or 2 beers on occasion won't do anything to anybody). 

She then said, by my logic, she can do what she wants, as long as she didn't cause harm to her or anyone else. I told her that I wouldn't care as long as she was safe about it. 



She brought up cocaine and I told her honestly, that if she was safe, I wouldn't care. Wrong thing to say I guess. But it's true. 



Was it wrong to break the promise? Yeah it was. But I don't care. And after her saying that I don't care about anything, I realized she is right in a way. 



I don't care that I broke a promise and lied to her. I don't care what she does, as long as she is safe.



I don't care if I didn't see her for a few weeks, or if she started using drugs. I honestly wouldn't. If she is faithful and safe, I don't have a problem with anything. I don't care. 



She doesn't like the fact I don't care, since she cares about so much, and I apparently let her down a lot, and she can't let me down. Causing circular arguments. 



I only have a few feelings, love, anger, and numb... I love her with all my heart. But I don't feel bad if I make her cry, or if she pisses me off to the point where I verbally abuse her. 



I know it's wrong, and I feel slightly bad when I loose control of my mouth and let anger do the talking. But I don't care. 



I don't understand stand what could be wrong, since I don't care about hardly anything. Not just in my relationship with my wife. But with everything. My job, the people I interact with. There is nothing there. And it worries me. 



I've read about depression and the effect it can have on the body. But this doesn't feel like how I'm told it should be... 



I'm not sad, I have plenty of motivation. Hell, I'd go as far to say I'm happy. I have my first daughter coming on Monday, I'm married to the woman of my dreams, and while we fight, it's not nearly as much as I hear about from other people. Less than one actual fight a month from what I can recall. With only slight disagreements in between. 



But I don't care about anything apart from my family. I'm numb. I'm exhausted and going to bed earlier and earlier. 



I don't know what to do, I'm going on vacation this Friday for 18 days to take care of my newborn and to help my wife recover. I'll make an appointment after I get back to speak with my Doc. 



But for now... Any ideas you think I should bring to my doctor?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Need to rant. Bounce stuff around.

Background on what led me to this feeling-

- I have recently had my confidence crushed on two separate occasions within the last couple of months. I started getting close to one girl who sat next to me in my History class. She did some subtle flirting, I took a metaphorical ""step"" closer which resulted in her revealing that she had a boyfriend from her previous school. My entire life I have been a pretty emotional person, but this simply crushed me. I remember we had a family emergency when my Grandpa was in the hospital and everyone thought that he was going to die. That was 3 months ago and I have yet to cry, even after I took a cross-country flight over there. Just last week I lost a friend because I started randomly laughing my ass of when he told me that his girlfriend broke up with him. I had no intention of doing so, but it just happened and I couldn't control it and feel awful for doing so. Then just yesterday I finally built up the confidence to ask a girl out for my first time ever and she accepted. I felt as if I was finally going to be able to repair myself emotionally by having someone there for me. Though due to the time that I asked her I wasn't able to get her number and I told her that I would contact her over Facebook after school. I got home eagerly and to my surprise she has removed me from Facebook. Haven't gotten a chance to talk to her about it, but the confidence that I built up is non-existent. Today I was hoping to be able to relieve some of the pressure that has been building up by watching ""12 Years a Slave"" for the first time in order to cry my eyes out with a good excuse just to find no emotional response to the film. Which is strange considering that my eyes would start tearing up if a teacher cold-called me for an answer to a question that I didn't know. I plan on trying again tomorrow with Schindler's List. 

Anyways, as of right now the problem is that I lack emotion except for laughing inappropriately, and lack much motivation. I would never turn to self-harm. I am simply seeking advice on what to do to relieve some of the pressure that is building up inside of me. 

I have a good feeling that I will be making some edits to this post for clarification, but as of right now I am tired as hell.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I am worried that I am a powder keg ready to go off.

My personal history is this: I have always been pretty smart for my age. All through my life, it seems I have always been too logical and it's hard for me to slip off routine. It's also very hard for me to read people. I lack the ability to give people mental states. Sometimes I do but it's only because I practiced a lot. When I was 5, I had friends which remained friends with me through strict rules for me to follow in order to act appropriately. It was simple, all I did was following the rules. I don't really remember much before I was 5. I always had trouble adapting to big changes and even small ones. I remember crying all alone in my room when my parents decided to redecorate a room. I was really gentle, really soft. A sweet young lad with really good and polite manners. I am a really passionate man, I have a passion for psychology and I want to understand others in a theoretical way. I still prefer looking at abnormal behavior though. Today I am still socially very awkward and I fail to know exactly what's the problem. I also have difficulty with change. My parents didn't note anything particular about my childhood. I try to do my best all the time to make myself pleasing but it's really really hard. I always tried this, as far as when I was 5 years old. I'm desperately trying to know what I have in order to find people like me. When I was young (before 5), I was capable of relationship and affection as well as doing role play game in which I did exceedingly well. Well enough for other parents to tell my own parents about the fact their children didn't play the same with me than with other children.

After I stopped taking Zoloft, my psychiatrist prescribed the 6mg/24 hr EMSAM patch. I stopped taking it after three days because the insomnia was terrible. 

I had a GeneSight panel done, and Zoloft is indeed an SSRI that is meant to work for me...but I just remember the nausea and the headaches and the dizziness and I'm afraid that if I don't try Zoloft, or at least *something*, again, then I won't be able to feel better about life in general. I fear my depression and the symptoms I've been having will simply not go away.

My field requires a great deal of creativity and brainstorming, and it feels like I'm losing the ability to do that effectively. I've tried Lexapro and Cymbalta in addition to the most recent EMSAM patches over the course of the past year, but to no avail. 

There's always a catch 22 though. When I'm *not* on medication, my head feels tight, closing my eyes and rotating my head gives me really bad nausea, I'm always tired and nauseated in general, and every single time I try to focus and concentrate on work, I start to space out and glaze over everything I'm reading. Pretty much how I feel when I'm *also* on medication. Nothing seems to be working. 

I should mention that I never followed through with medication like this over a long term basis. The side effects I experienced were just too overwhelming. But I want to be able to focus again, have clarity of thought, and to not feel dizzy/nauseated 24/7. At the same time, I don't want to be bored and unmotivated, which I believe the meds could help with. Perhaps I should have stuck with the 25mg dose instead of going up to 50mg? How could I ever know without trying again? Would I be better off just trying to not take any medication for a year or so, so that way my body can be fully rid of medication and, possibly, the side effects with it?

She's going to counseling but they can't diagnose her until her teen hormones calm. In the mean time the councilors justify her bad behavior, she throws fits, goes from calm to panic in seconds and used to cut herself. Looking for resources and moral support. 

My younger sister is 15 years old. Mom knew she was wired a little differently at a young age. My family has a history of depression and bipolar disorder on both sides of the family (My father has both and is a very bad influence on her). My sister started showing danger signs while I was living out of the house and about two years ago she confessed to cutting herself. We immediately addressed the situation, taking her to weekly counseling and being supportive of her situation. 

She was given meds but they made her worse, so treatment was stopped in that regard. She eventually stopped cutting and I believe it's been about a year now since it last happened. 

It's a confusing situation. She is a wonderful girl who gets good marks, is respectful with other parents and has good friendships with good people. I believe she has started to dabble in a drink or two but nothing out of the ordinary. However when she's home she accuses everyone of hating her, demands money and high priced items, refuses to eat her suppers and can take a simple conversation and turn it into a screaming match. Her councilors often tell her things that she will take home and use against her family in manipulative ways. She has begun to largely ignore her sessions and things are escalating. 

She has no coping skills and often escalates from 0 to 200 in seconds. Instead of seeing any logic, she will immediately see the negative and begin screaming and crying about how no one cares, despite the whole family offering suggestions and bending over backwards. She has anxiety attacks over something as simple as choosing a snack or needing to make a decision. She has nightmares consistently about rape, although it's never happened to her. 

A lot of this sounds like ""typical teenage stuff"" but I assure you it's not. We're concerned that she won't be able to cope with life challenges like having a job or living alone. She'll be 16 at the end of the month and I thank god there's no car for her to drive. 

We want her to be happy, healthy and respectful of others. She has a great life and everything she needs and a bit of what she wants. She acts like we abuse her when in truth, she verbally abuses my mother everyday. My father is useless in the situation and I will soon be out of country for a year. I don't know what to do and anything would help. Stories, resources, anything. We don't want to give up on her but we can't live like this.

I've been on anti depressants for depression, but I'm sure it was a bandaid for symptoms caused by something else.

I've been on Ritalin for ADHD for the part few months, but a similar story I think. I thought it would solve everything, but it hasn't, and I'm out of options. Currently exploring Noopept, but like everything else it seems to have such subtle effects if any, but it's only been a few days.

What else is there? I've considered hypnotherapy, getting an MRI for possible physical problems, but in getting tired of nothing changing and apathetic about even bothering.

The one thing that stands out is my dreams. In them, I am alert, confident, driven, social, and have great mental acuity. This can even spill over into my waking world for brief moments, before the fog sets in again. Im sure this is a critical clue, but I have no idea who to talk to about this, nor do I have the money to try.

I desperately WANT to be that person, but just am unable to be, no matter what I try. What do I do??

I have done a little bit of research on it, but I'm looking for some solid answers I suppose.

Let me introduce my situation:

We've lived at our current place for almost 2 years, and have asked several times about getting a cat. We heard nothing until we finally got a solid and nondescript ""No."" There are other people in the complex who have pets.

I spoke to my therapist a week ago and she said she definitely would consider writing me a recommendation, but I need to get a little bit more info on it before we go through with it.

So I just have some basic questions:

-What would be the proper way to go around this seeing as how we already got a ""no"" from the owner?

-Do they have any basis in kicking us out for this?

-I read that they cannot charge us a pet deposit if it is a pet recommended through a licensed therapist under the ADA. Is this true?

-If we end up moving in the future and try to apply for a no-pets place WITH the recommendation, will we most likely be denied?

And incredibly deep grief from a recent loss of my grandma (she was essentially my parent after my biological parents had died). So in other words, add grief on top of all this, and you get absolute chaos. 


Two years ago, I had a complete psychotic break. I don't remember what caused it, I don't remember was actions were taken, but the aftermath has been a terrible battle seeking normality. I like to say that my brain ""broke"", it's a good description because it is essentially the biggest dose of Fuckitol^TM one can take. I did nothing for days. And then weeks. And then months. And then it became a year. 


Last year I was finally doing pretty well. Enrolled in 16 credits of classes I enjoyed and get A's in. But then...I had nothing to do, so back to Fuckitol^TM mode. Everything was just blah for a while, and then I collapsed again. Didn't take finals the next semester, withdrew from all but two classes. 


Then my grandma went into hospice and I got pneumonia: bacterial, both lungs. She worsened at a pretty surprisingly slow rate over the course of a month. Then she passed. I got bacterial pneumonia in both lungs for a second time. 


The combination of pneumonia and losing the closest person to me that is not my husband, wreaked havoc on my mentally. I shut down. I broke. I contemplated suicide. I started doing little self-mutilations that would heal (plucking hairs, finding spots on arms that seem to be needing a pop). My self-care was horrendous, and is only slightly better. 


Sorry if this just seems like a bunch of rambling.  Has anyone experienced anything similar to this, or know someone who has? Would anyone have any advice on this I can do to ""put my brain back together""? I would really  be grateful for suggestion. Feel free to ask questions, on the content or for clarity of a subject.

My life doesnt really feel like its moving forward. 

I can think of many things to do like applying for work, sorting things around the house,etc but I just dont feel like doing them. Just the thought of forcing myself to do them makes me feel like shit, and I often excuse myself from doing them for a later time. Its like ""Ah fuck it, I cant be bothered"" or ""This is not worth your time""  and I go back to reading on the internet. I just feel like I cant be bothered to do anything. I have noticed that I have to force myself to even get up and do  things. When I was younger this wasnt really a problem. I think this image sums it up pretty well - http://imgur.com/QEhXs

I feel like I read too much on the internet. More than 8 hours a day. I think its to distract myself from feeling low and bored. I find that when I wake up in the morning, I have this craving for stimulation. I find that its hard for me to try to spend the first hour of the day not on the computer. I think its almost like an addiction.

I have noticed that I have developed a dislike for corporate and neoliberal culture. I find most of it to be bullshit and having no substance or depth. But whenever I talk to people or walk around the city, I find that they have been affected by it and dont see through it which makes me feel sad. Like its all going down the drain. I think its probably to do with reading too much on the internet.

I find that at certain places and at certain times of the day I have the same thoughts as the day before. For example, when I take a nap in the afternoon, I have thoughts of having let myself down regarding a certain goal in my life. I think about how my life would have been if I had achieved this goal and how the hell did I end up like this, which then makes me feel low.

My sex drive on the other hand seems to be quite high. But I havent had a partner in over 5 months so there is no outlet.

I find myself analyzing my actions and feelings,sometimes, from a moral point of view. For example, whether sometimes what I do makes me a bad person for doing it.

Sometimes I feel like life is meaningless and often feel like ""WTF is this?! What is happening?!""

I have noticed that my thoughts have 2 layers. The top layer is where I consciously think of something. But below it is a layer where whenever I think something a negative thought automatically crops up to pull it down. Sometimes its very faint, sometimes clear. I always feel like something is pulling my mood down and its a constant struggle to keep pulling it up. It tires me. I think to drown that low feeling, I read a lot on the internet. But if I try to concentrate on a book it doesnt really work.

I also almost all the time have a song stuck in my head. Not sure if this is relevant but I thought I would mention in case it is.

Other people's lives seem to be far better than mine.One of the reasons why I have stopped checking out my facebook news feed. My friends havent called or texted me since 4 weeks either, even to wish me on a big recent festival. That thought alone brings me down the most. It always seems like I am the one texting or calling my friends rather than the other way around. The only call I do get is from my mum or aunt! Loneliness really really gets to me, to the point that I feel physically ill.

Whenever I think of future prospects, I tend to think of what might go wrong. For example, if I went to graduate school to pursue a masters, what if I fuck it up like my undergraduate. What if I cant do it. I think its something to do with my self confidence taking a big hit because of a certain incident in university.

I feel that something in me is broken, which is preventing me from taking my life further and improve it, even though economic times are tough. But I just dont know what exactly is broken and how to repair it. 

So please advise.

Other bad habits...my mom said that the things holding me back the most in life will be laziness and self-consciousness. I dunno if I'm lazy, though, because I can't help it a lot of the time, especially when it's something I'm nervous about starting. I procrastinate pretty badly, and I'm pretty forgetful, but at the same time, I think I'm pretty good and remembering facts and things like that. I'm rather emotional, and can easily be brought to tears. I think I've always been pretty self-conscious, and I'm not sure about the motivation thing.

I don't think many even know what that means. People constantly tell me that all I have to do is fake it, and eventually the illusion will become real. That if I pretend to be the person I want to be, I'll be that person and everything will fall into line.

The problem is, that by definition, my disorder is always 'faking it' to 'make it'. Even realizing that the issues I have with myself are based in bad self-image, and that the way I feel about myself is not the way other people feel about me (hopefully?). I still am not able to take pride in myself, develop self-confidence or believe in my abilities. Everything I do seems so surreal. Everything I say feels cheap and imitated. Everything just seems like I'm lying to everyone and waiting to be found out as a fraud. I feel like everyone I meet is always judging me so negatively. I feel like I never make a good impression on anyone. I feel stupid, ugly, disgusting even. I feel like I'm missing some component to my humanity that everyone else has figured out but I just can't seem to grasp.

I'm caught in an existential crisis. I don't feel like I exist like other people, I feel inherently flawed, and worse I feel like the flaw I have is something I can't fix. I feel like no one can ever love me because I'm so flawed. Every accomplishment I have means nothing. Every good deed I've done means nothing. Everyone I've helped would have got by fine without me. I rate myself based on what I'm doing at this exact moment, not what I've done in the past. If I was made to feel attractive by the fairer sex in the past, that relationship has ended, therefore I'm ugly now. If I was thought to be intelligent in the past, that's gone, today I am an idiot. If I was praised for something I've done in the past, it means nothing, today I've done nothing. I am a being in need of constant reinforcement to feel momentarily at peace with myself.

How am I to break this cycle. This feeling so deeply ingrained into my personality that it's literally a personality disorder? How do you undo a personality? Every time I gain a little bit of conviction and set out to destroy this terrible self-proclaimed stigma, I realize that everything I'm doing to fight it is a lie. That I'm only deceiving myself, and any work I put into it comes undone. I fall right back into that state of utter depression, self mutilation and apathy towards life.

The best way to describe it is if I see conversations and somehow it relates to my train of thought. So, for instance, I was watching a youtube video on math and I thought the answer was 0.3125 and it was actually 0.03125. Point is, when I got it wrong simultaneously another conversation between my mother and grandmother was taking place, and they were talking about being wrong (in scrabble). 

I knew for a fact they were talking about scrabble. They didn't even know I made a mistake, but my minds thoughts make their conversation about me.

Any it's about everything. No matter how mundane or context. The second a conversation has a part that could revolve around me, it's as though it IS about me.

The other thing of this is I sometimes, for a few moments, basically forget my train of thought. There's a few times when my mind is waiting for ""other people"" but in reality I'm the one speaking. When it happens it's horrible, because I'll be in conversation and forget basically every word, every train of thought.

I display most of the symptoms, though not nearly as badly as many people i've heard of. I do have very bad dependency issues in relationships and I get attached incredibly easily, i've traced this back to my narcissistic mother and passive aggressive father and their guilt manipulation tactics throughout my childhood. That's not why i'm here. 

I struggle with insecurity in very specific parts of my life. I am absolutely terrified of singing, dancing, and buying clothing. Not sure why this is, it seems to be that i'm afraid of expressing myself physically. It's like I never learned how to. I'll do all of this stuff in private, but when it comes to talking to people in person, I end up boring people or putting them off because I don't convey myself at all through a physical medium. I wear the same t-shirts and jeans for clothing because I have no idea what else to get and the insecurity because of this is nearly crippling. I feel disgusting even though I know that not everyone views me that way. I play music very well, namely guitar and piano, and I write in order to express myself because I do it so poorly through my body. I didn't dance at either of the proms I went to, and I avoid concerts completely even though I love music because i'm afraid of being in a room full of dancing/singing people while I stand there terrified. 

In combination with this are mood swings that happen out of nowhere. I become incredibly depressed for hours at a time, but rarely more than that. It can happen multiple times a day, and usually does happen at least once every couple of days. It's rare that I have a day without feeling this way. I can separate myself from it for the most part because i've realized that these moods aren't contingent upon reality and that they're created out of what's probably a chemical imbalance, since I can't see any other reason for it. The main issue is that these depressive periods absolutely kill my motivation, which is something I desperately need because i'm in engineering school. I become empty and apathetic and nothing seems appealing. The only thing that consistently registers as appealing for me is female attention. I crave assurance and affirmation, especially from the opposite sex. It leads to me far over-shooting expectations in relationships at first and then crashing down into dependency at the first signs of abandonment. During and after intense relationships are when i'm most depressed. After my last relationship ended, my mood swings would happen almost non-stop and every day for a month and didn't get better until recently, a few months afterwards.

I don't know if all of these problems are connected, but I suspect that they are. I'm in therapy currently, but talk therapy has yet to help me because I'm already incredibly self-aware and most of what the therapists tell me is stuff I know about myself.

I've begun to really think that my mother suffers from this. If anyone has experience about how to handle a relative with this disorder, please let me know. Here's a list of the signs I've noticed and pieced together recently:

1) Throughout childhood, she was extremely critical of me, despite my academic performance and good behavior. I have had to deal with feelings of inadequacy and guilt, and only as an adult have realized that I am not an evil or terrible person. 

2) Although I have long since moved out, she still accuses me of taking small things from her house. I leave her house feeling like I need a shower. Seriously,she holds onto the belief that I am an evil person and a petty, delusional liar. Thanksgiving: the entire evening ""Well, we haven't killed each other yet!"" (*chuckle chuckle*). the next day: ""Where's my CD? You really have a problem with taking things from me. You need to leave now."" (For the record, I have never even seen that CD at her house, nor do I have any interest in that type of music).

2b.) she goes so far out of her way to justify her conviction that I steal things, that when the missing item is found, she accuses me of
       sneaking into her house and returning the item. No trust, no respect, I am a delusional lying thief. 

3) She likes to be in complete control and offers me things only so that she can use that to exert dominance. For example, she will offer to take me on vacation or out to dinner, and then control what we do or what I eat since she is paying.

4) She is extremely concerned about appearing ""normal"" to the degree that she coaches me on what to do in front of neighbors or relatives.

5) Holiday disorder- she has expectations of how things will go at family events or holiday get-togethers, and then purposefully sabotages our interactions by accusing me of things.

I'm only considering this because a certain manager is extremely mean to me and micromanages. She will assign 6 tasks to me and will always comment on the way I'm working no matter what I'm doing. It's causing me massive anxiety anytime I'm working with her. I have to focus on one task at a time, otherwise I feel overwhelmed. I also can't work my best because I feel immense pressure to preform perfectly. 

The bipolar however isn't a concrete diagnosis yet, so I wont bring that up I think. but I may explain my moods are very volatile and while I'm fairly good at handling this, there's certain triggers that I can avoid if my coworkers/managers help me. 

An analogy I've used in the past is somebody with a bad back. Everybody knows this person has a bad back, and certain tasks are difficult to them due to this, so they may need extra help and patience. They also understand when they're having a bad back day. That's essentially how my anxiety is. 

I'm just not really sure how to approach this whole thing. Mental illness is really misunderstood anf people don't get hat I cant just ""get over it."" I'm also afraid this will just make them treat me like a child, or like I'm inept.

We had just moved because my parents didn't want me to grow up in a bad neighbourhood in the city and we landed in a small village with about 1000 inhabitans. It didnt have much except a kindergarden, an elementary school and a really old monastery so I immidiately felt out of place and was starting school in the first grade with new people.

The kids in my class had already had years to get to know each other through kindergarden and daycare etc. and I was the outsider. I did however make friends and things were good for a while.

After about three or four months I started to notice that some kids were picked on, it was mostly the kids that were into sports and played football all the time who led this bullying but everybody including me and my friends participated every now and again.

Things started getting bad for me when we were in about third grade then they started targeting me for being fat and out of shape which I was and it made me extremely insecure and upset about going to school. It was around this time I decided that I was not going to be a victim and started to get more and more tough and cruel to the already bullied children.

It worked. I was almost never targeted by the ""jocks"" after that. I felt bad for the children I bullied at first but as time went on I just stopped caring and it became natural for me to bully people. I didnt even think about it as a form of getting attention away from me anymore it just felt like me.

Part of this whole charade which had been going on for years was that I was always the funny guy who came up with jokes, both harmless jokes and jokes on other peoples expense. I think this was also because I was insecure and it felt comfortable to just slip into character and ""put on a mask"" of the funny guy instead of showing my real feelings of remorse early on.

Junior high was easy for me since by then I was very tall and pretty fat so I looked intimidating and since this was a school in the city it was all kinds of people from all over who didnt really know each other and being a big guy helped, sure it gave me attention but nobody dared say or do anything mean and mixing the scary big guy act with the funny guy act really worked wonders, I got lots of friends and none of the kids I bullied went to this school so I thought my past was safe and nobody would find out what I had done.

I felt good for a while but I started to notice now that I didnt really need to hide behind a mask anymore I wasnt sure about who I was and what my real personality was like and I started having thoughts that I had killed myself by putting on theese acts all theese years and no longer had a real personality and again out of fear but this time of myself I started bullying again just to make sure nobody would see that I was completely fake and hollow on the inside.

I have since then kept it up, three years of jr. high, three years of highschool, two years at work and now one year of college. I dont really bully people anymore since that is not something a grown up should do instead I just stick to the funny act and it works, I have lots of friends both online and irl but nobody know that its just an act, something I do to keep up appearances.

I have never had a romantic relashionship, not even as a kid and im afraid that I never will. I dont really think I deserve it after all the pain i've caused and the lives i've ruined(some of the people I bullied started doing drugs in high school and just generally fucked up their lives and im pretty sure its because of me).

I dont really feel that much any more, I dont think I love a single person, not even my parents or my sister or any of my friends and I dont really feel depressed or sad except when I think about things like this and realize that I should feel bad and that I should be depressed, the only thing I ""feel"" is the fleeting moment of joy when I laugh or make somebody else laugh but since I know thats fake it doesnt really comfort me. I dont even really feel bad about what I have done other than the fact that I know thats how I should feel.

In a way I think that I should be happy for my lack of emotion, I have relatives who have battled with depression their entire lives and seeing how their lives are I think im pretty lucky that I cant feel that way but the flipside is ofc that I will never really be happy or feel love.

So now we are in the present. I haven't been depressed until recently and it is the worst bout I have had. I am a college student in my final semester, but I have lost all ambition and drive. My grades have suffered immensely because of this. I have gained about 15 pounds in a little over a month.

The way things are going I think if I keep hiding my moods I might just explode (I have not intention of hurting anyone or myself). I have considered going for a psychiatric evaluation but I am afraid of what they will say and most of all telling my parents.

I would like to have a good resource that people can go to (or compile one myself if necessary) when they first suspect they have an illness, or may be concerned about a friend or family member.

My realization is that there are different licensing rules in different locales regarding who can diagnose what (In the US, it seems that each state may have different rules). And that some illnesses are less known or understood than others, so seeing someone who specializes in that illness would be more beneficial, but first you need to determine if you have the illness. I also know that in some places only certain types of coverage is provided. I think in Canada for example, I was told that psychologists aren't covered, but a psychiatrist is, because they're a medical doctor. I guess also a diagnosis is different from an assessment, because I have received a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, but an assessment from a psychologist. The psychiatrist basically asked me a number of questions and gauged from the DSM IV (now V) what I had, but a psychologist assessed me with tests. I think the latter provided a clearer diagnosis, actually, but they can be expensive (unless you're lucky they're subsidized somehow).

So I guess my question is, what is a good place to direct people so they can best find help.

I found this description of mental health professionals on the mayo clinic site, but it really seems to say, it depends on laws, training and experience for each professional.

It was a very surreal experience as he walked around, saw family members he hasn't seen in years and slipped out of being at least partially aware, to seeing things that weren't there. My mother was very frightened but I assumed he was sleepwalking and hoped it would be a one night thing.

This day he seemed normal (so I assumed I was right about the sleep walking), but when nightfell, I realized he was in the grip of whatever happened last night again. Last night, it wasn't so bad since he was only talking to family and such, but this night was worse. He claimed there were rats in the house and set out to find them, moving bags and clothes and such around, at times whacking bags with his cane. Worse, he talked about getting a machete out of the garage (I don't think there's on there?) and asked us to pass him a knife so he could gut the rats. As the minutes went by, the talk of rat turned to talk of a little burglar man and an uninvited old lady hiding amongst the bags and clothes. He even tried calling 911 on them but I managed to coerce the phone from him (by telling him that I would give then directions). To be sure, he always recognizes me (and my brother, and my mother); it's not that he doesn't know where he is.

This went on for two hours before he calmed enough to head to bed, but I have no idea if he's asleep yet (30 minutes later now), or just awake in the his room (I don't want to check for fear of raising him).

Can anyone tell me more about sleepwalking? I googles what little I could, but that told me that sleep walking's only supposed to last for fifteen to thirty minutes. This has gone on longer, and it's got me worried maybe I'm wrong. First thing tomorrow (when he seems himself), I'm taking him to the family doctor for help, but is there anything I should keep in mind until then?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Need help/have questions about sleepwalking father.

I always knew he was a little bit emotionally...dulled, for lack of a better word. His previous relationship caused him to become closed off, suspicious, and very close to devoid of the capability to show affection. These are all things I learned when I was already well in love. There's more to him than these things, and I was relieved when he told me, because I felt like opening up was the first hurdle to being able to work on himself.

As a bipolar patient myself, he has been extremely patient and loving through my spells. He deals with me well, and challenges me as well as comforts me in times of great strife.

But things have devolved. In the last 6 months or so, he has become what I consider emotionally abusive. I could almost guarantee that he has narcissistic personality disorder. Everything is my fault, he has started to yell and throw objects (never at me, but somehow that doesn't make me feel better), I always end up apologizing because he's mad at me for being mad at him. He is constantly puffing up his chest about great things he has done that day, about how much people like him, and it's wearing on me. The reason I haven't left is because I think he is truly mentally ill, and he knows he needs help too. I don't know what to take before I truly break, but because I have my own mental health issues to deal with, I know I can't let him destroy me. I want to help him, because he has helped me and because we have truly built something great together.

His doctor has prescriibed him an antidepressant and given him a referral to a psychologist and told him to fill one or see the other, or both. He had performance related issues on his last medication (anxiety), so he doesn't want to take another medication. He still hasn't called the psychologist's office (this was about six weeks ago).

Is there a way I can explain to her that she is not to call me anymore that will actually work?  I had to end a friendship with somebody with bipolar disorder before, and it was very messy. There were no threats of any sort, just that the person that refused to acknowledge that the friendship was over for a long time. This person took to telling me I was a horrible friend and I should be ashamed of the way I was treating her in her time of need.  It was very sad, and very disconcerting.   That person at least tried to keep up with her medication, but the person I'm having issues with now has likely not been medicated since she was a teenager.  

So, since telling her we no longer had anything in common, and specifically telling her not to call me anymore didn't work, are there any other suggestions of ways to cut contact with her?  When she lived in another state it was very easy to just ignore her, but now she is suddenly moving very nearby.

I experienced an absolutely horrible trip....I won't go too far into details but I basically experienced a prolonged psychotic episode.  I went to hell, experienced pain that I never thought possible, and completely lost it during this trip.  My mind was making these insanely fast connections.  My thoughts moved from one topic/idea to another so quickly it was scary.  My mind was somehow connecting all these thoughts.  Looking back, it's obvious these thoughts had no relation and that my head wasn't on straight.  But at the time I was fully and 100% convinced they were true.  I became convinced that the world was a simulation and the my entire existence was just one long joke being played out on me.  It was the scariest and by far the worst experience of my life.

Anyway, now almost a month later I'm still experiencing lasting effects from this terrible trip.  For a while I had trouble distinguishing what was real.  My trip was so real to me that the reality I experienced while high seemed like it could be just as real as the reality we experience right now.  My entire identity was based off my accomplishments in this world, so not being 100% convinced that this world is real and matters has shattered my ego.  Sometimes my thoughts return to this delusional pattern of thinking about simulation, etc.  I'm not as happy or upbeat as I was before.  I'm suffering from a bit of solopsism.  At times I believe I'm the only thing that's real.

I wish I had never tried weed.  I have so much more respect for it now.  Consciousness is not something to be fucked with. The way friends and people online talk about it - they make it seem like child's play. I understand I used it irresponsibly, but my case is proof that there needs to be more information out there about the negative effects weed can have on your psyche.

I have my good and bad days.  Just a few days ago I was feeling great and thought I was back to normal.  Now I'm moderately depressed again and experiencing these somewhat delusional thoughts again...having trouble sleeping because I think these thought patterns scare me.

Anyway, this is kind of my first step towards admitting I have a problem that may not go away with time.  I'm not even sure what to do...I will search online for help but any suggestions would be much appreciated.  I don't really know where to start.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,First Step

I'm relatively new to reddit so, if this isn't the right place for this, I apologise.

Basically, I'm a creative writing student who has been through a lot of mental health issues in the past. From self harming, anxiety, agoraphobia and now depression. However, like a lot of people who suffer with mental illness, I did not know when I was self harming, when I had an anxiety disorder or when I had depression what it was and I felt abnormal. The only escape I ever had, and still utilise, is through my writing.

Because of this lack of knowledge I want my final creative writing assignment, which is 10 poems, to be based upon mental illness to help raise awareness. I want to give a voice through writing to people often silenced by embarrassment and disregarded by society (like I) and give an honest insight in to the true symptoms of the illnesses that I shall cover.

For this, I need a little help. As every mental illness is so varied and every personal story is different, I would like to hear how your mental illness affects you. Prior to editing, I listed different mental illnesses i'd like to cover, but after some thought every single story will be different and inspiring, irrelevant of the categorisation given. I have still included the list here:



Obsessive compulsive disorder
Anxiety
Depression
Paranoid Schizophrenia
Eating disorder
Bipolar
Pyromania
PTSD
antisocial personality disorder
Tic Disorder
Somatoform disorder


But, as I said, any personal story would really help me with the process.



The questions I'd like to ask are:

When did you first notice that you may have a condition? Was it yourself or someone else?

What are the symptoms?

Would you change any of these if you were given the opportunity?

What has your illness taught you?

How do you feel during the worst times (spare nothing, I will not judge)?

How do you feel during the good times?

What has your experience taught you?

What are your hopes and dreams for the future?

And, ultimately, do you feel our society needs to improve in relation to the acceptance of mental illnesses?



 

tl;dr Would really help a student out if you have any experience with mental illness, if you could answer even a few of the questions listed above! Plan to help raise awareness through poetry within my university.

Fair enough, we let him stay. After a week or two he found a decent job he stayed at for 2 months and a half or 3 months and was ""let go"". Now he reads books and watches TV, mostly reads and doesn't do much.. He was given a deadline to get his act together and find another job. Not much appears to have been done and his deadline is Friday... Oh and also back when he had the job and was working, I know for a fact he wasn't paying any of his debts yet he could only muster up like $200 a month to cover for his part of rent/expenses.. No idea where is pay was going..

He has pretty big amounts of debts, total amount unknown to me, but must be significant. He lived like 2 years in an apartment he completely destroyed and didn't pay for before he was homeless. Cigarettes burn everywhere, sodas and stuff spilled and not cleaned up everywhere, Pepsi bottles filled with urine under his bed.. Today one of those was found in his room.. What the fuck, I just don't get this..

He never had any government ID, refuses to get heath insurance, doesn't want professional/medical help or counselling and he acts as if everything is fine..

If he is wrong he'll just make shit up to ""win"" the argument) but what he does life wise makes no sense... He ALWAYS lies about everything even insignificant stuff.

Does anyone here have any idea of what could be wrong with him? Or any way I could help? 

He doesn't seem suicidal or depressed.. Does't seem wiling to change either though.. I think that he maybe was sexually abused in his youth..

the rest of this post i pretty much backstory of my depression and how i have tried to deal with it.

A little back info for my depression:

When i was about 12 years old i started cutting i felt like the world was coming to an end and told myself that id be better off dead. i told my parents how i was feeling but they said god would help me that god would be there for me if i just prayed. they thought it was a phase teenage angst something i would get over with in a couple of years.  i asked them then begged them to take me to the doctor but they said it was ""all in my head"" if i got out more id feel better. they didn't seem to understand that as much as i tried i just couldn't bring myself to be around people. i've dealt with it since then most days are fine but sometimes i have have months and months of dark days where i cry every night and can barely bring myself to get up  in the morning. this time in particular has been really trying for me.

Current Depression (within the last year or two) and issues with medication:

last year i was caught shoplifting at a supermarket. after a legal mandate i had my chance to see a psychologist i was diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder and OCD. my mom always sat in during my sessions so i never truly felt free  to talk and as much as i wanted her to leave she said she had the right as my parent to be there throughout the whole thing. nothing was really done beyond the diagnosis. 

i am now 17 and have been living with my depression for 5 years with no treatment. i have went to a few doctors but they were mostly dissuaded by my moms list of concerns including:

 ""what if she becomes addicted""  i was put on meds for epilepsy when i was 8 (around 1967) and i missed out on my childhood what if that happens to her"" ""what if she becomes addicted"" ""i dont want my daughter on meds for the rest of her life. will she be on these for the rest of her life"" "" i don't want her to become dependant"" ""her father used to smoke pot he has an addictive personality. what if she does too?"" ""i dont want her to become like some of those kids who are addicted to ritalin or anything like that""

these same questions are asked over and over. this last time the doctor made an appointment to see a psychologist so he could better prescribe medication for my illness. he agreed it was in my best interest to have a prescription to help with my depression. 

 my mom is too worried that i may become addicted and doesn't want to buy it for me. ive told her that i just want her to be supportive. she has the right to be concerned but i'm tired of living in a state on unhappiness. 

 i began cutting again after pretty much altogether stopping for around three years.

after five years of trying to feel better by eating better trying to go out more and exercising with very little results i feel like i need to try to take medication. i have tried and tried to explain this to her but it never seems to get across. im not sure what to do but i know i cant do this much longer.

We got married a year or so ago. I am living in her country (in asia) and I am having a difficult time with her.

I want to preface this by telling you, 90% of the time, my wife is the most loving, compassionate and forgiving person on the planet.  She is blissful to be around, and is happy, and joyous and pleasurable.  This crazy thing she does, is pretty rare, but it hits so hard, and with increasing frequency, I am worried it will someday lead to an action taken on her part, or mine which could result in a truly un-fixable situation.

Maybe I can break it down into a few stories about her, and maybe I can get some advice on how to pinpoint a way to get some help.  Because we live in Asia, any kind of mental health issue is treated as taboo, and is very difficult to get anyone to get help for, since it basically admits weakness in mind, of of the gravest weaknesses.  (sigh)

1. I knew she had some issues with anger, and control of her temper.  She will randomly fixate on something she thinks happened, and then twist it into a way that I have insulted, or hurt her, even if it's really a mistake or a miscommunication.

example: I work at a radio station as a part-time fun gig. We had a Christmas concert last December.  It was my first, and I was unsure what to expect. But, I was obviously performing, and doing some fun acting etc etc.  My wife and I arrived at the concert, and I had to get prepared. So I made sure she was OK by herself, and went backstage to prepare.

After a while, and a few text messages back and forth, it was time to perform. I went out, did my thing, and afterward, she texted me I was funny, and she was happy to see me etc.  I had some more things to do later in the show, and I wasnt aware how long I would have to wait. so I told her to wait patiently, and I would be on again soon.  We texted several times, and only about 45 minutes had past between texts when I wondered how she was, and texted her that we should be starting soon.  She never replied back, and so I called her, no answer.  I called again, and she picked up. I asked her how she liked the band that was playing.  She told me she was on her way home, and I should go stay somewhere else tonight.  (this was very sudden onset of anger and frustration on her part)

After finishing the concrt, I rushed home, to find she had changed the door code on our new apartment, and left me my cell-phone charger and a note.  dont remember exactly what it was, but it was about staying away etc.

Finally, after about 10 minutes of ringing the doorbell, calling etc she finally answers the phone.  we talk, and it turns out she was upset because I aparantly left her, in a room full of kids, at a concert she now hated for no reason and never took care of her.

Long story kind of short, I managed to talk my way into the house, and finally calm her down with much pleading and apologizing, while trying to maintain that I had no idea she was having a bad time. how could I?

Now, this is not the first thing like this, but its really a clear case where she was fine one minute, and then completely illogical and unable to process information properly.  She does this often at least once a month.

Now, these kinds of outbursts DO happen more frequently around her period, suggesting maybe PMDD or some other hormone imbalance, but I am not sure if that's truly the cause, since she can go off at any time of the month with predictable results.

2. Today, on our second anniversary of our first date, she got upset because aparantly I was distracted (we are in the process of planning a very stressful move to Canada, where I am from) during dinner, and when she asked me to get her some more ketchup, aparantly I wasnt pleasant enough to her, and uttered a ""sure"" or something which about 8 hours later, after thinking about it ad-nauseum I guess she took for me being the rudest person on the planet, and worthy of a divorce. Also she brings up many of the other times she has gone crazy as proof we are the worst couple ever etc etc...  sigh

Now, usually, the outbursts are small enough I can talk her down within an hour or two, but they are leving lasting scars and making me walk on tiptoes around my on house and wife for no reason.

I know there is something I can do for her, and something she can do for herslef, but I want to be prepared to talk to her about it delicately, as I have mentioned, mental health in asia is not something you want to talk about unless it's serious, and debilitating. I dont wish to go into this process with doctors and nurses, checkups and tests without having as much information as I can get.  Unfortunatly, there is little in the way of English-speaking help I can count on here in Asia.

I need help, anyone with a similar experience, or at least can point me in the right direction.. please help.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My wife (32) is straining our marriage with anger and irrational outbursts of uncontrolled emotions.

Ultimately, we want to include it in our sidebar. As yet, we're still a very small sub, so I haven't been able to get much feedback just by posting it there.

I don't think I can finish this without hearing opinions and suggestions from a few more people, so now I'm sharing it with r/psychology and r/mentalhealth as well. Please let me know what you think!

The aim of this glossary is fairly simple. I believe the coining of a range of new words and new concepts has been one of the main ways that other identity movements have got off the ground, and since neurodiversity politics is probably just as complicated as things like gender and race politics, I think we could do with some clear terms to help us to think more clearly and advocate more precisely. 

Some of the words I have included here are already well established. Others are words have been borrowed from other movements, or haven’t (in my opinion) got enough use in the neurodiversity movement so far. Finally, a few are inventions of my own. These may or may not be useful, so do please let me know what you think.

[Note: the first entry is intended mainly for the flairs in our sub. All of the rest are general purpose.]


**Neurodiversity Glossary**:


**The tags: ‘[M]’ ,‘[D]’ and ‘[B]’**: Some people obviously prefer to think of their conditions as differences rather than disorders, while others find the medical point of view more helpful. This varies even among people with the same condition, and can make it difficult to know what kind of language to use. To make this simpler, I suggest the use of the tags [M], [D], and [B] standing for “medical”,“difference”, and “both”. In other words, Anxiety[M] would indicate: “I have anxiety, and I prefer to think of it as a medical condition.” Meanwhile, Aspergers[D] would mean: “I have Aspergers, and I consider it a difference rather than a medical condition. Finally, ADHD[B] would mean: “I have ADHD, and I find both medical and non-medical descriptions useful, depending on the situation. Importantly, if you are talking about someone else, this tag should refer to how THEY identify. If not, we are forcing them to identify in a particular way, which is exactly what the neurodiversity movement is trying to avoid. (If you don’t know, don’t use a tag.)

**Allistic:** Non-autistic.

**Alternormative:** Refers to social, communication, and other norms that exist outside neurotypical circles, but are not inherently pathological. To illustrate this, imagine a group of people having a conversation. One person in the group is on the autism spectrum, and struggles to understand a lot of the social subtleties of the situation. The mainstream interpretation of this situation would be that the person on the autism spectrum has a simple social deficiency. However, we can imagine a group of people on the autism spectrum, and in this group, a neurotypical person who struggles to understand all of the subtleties of communication. When this is the case, saying the person with autism simply has a social deficiency because they function better in the non-NT group doesn’t make much sense. Instead we’d probably want to be talking about a minority population with a different set of social or conversational norms. “Alternormative” refers to this alternative set of norms. Of course, this term will not always be appropriate: some non-NTs will find it harder to communicate across the board, including to others with similar differences. Ultimately, the term “alternormative” expresses a “difference” view of nontypical interactions, especially in cases where a “deficiency view” is unhelpful. 

**Disorder/Disease:** The main difference between a “disorder” and a “disease” is that a disease is often considered temporary, potentially treatable and caused by something external, while a disorder is lifelong and intrinsic to that person. Both the word “disorder” and the word “disease” belong to the medical model. In many circles, they are used interchangeably, but we find the distinction helpful.

**Difference:** A way of referring to a neurological condition without implying it is a disorder.

**Erasure:** The omission of representations of a certain group of people and to their experiences, e.g. in advertising, in literature, or in television.

**Illness/disease/sickness:** These medical-model words are sometimes distinguished in the philosophy of mental health, with “illness” referring to a person’s experiences and symptoms, “disease” referring to the underlying process, and “sickness” referring to the social role taken on by the person when they become a patient. There is still some debate about this, but this is the breakdown of meaning that I have seen most often, and I find it helpful. We might also distinguish “syndrome,” for identifying a collection of commonly co-occuring symptoms without making any presupposition about the cause.

**Language-normative:** Communication that privileges linguistic, conceptual thinking over other kinds of thinking.

**Medicalization:** “To identify or categorize (a condition or behavior) as a disorder requiring medical treatment or intervention”. Medicalisation is not, in itself, a bad thing, but it can be inappropriate or unhelpful at times.

**Medicalism:** A way of thinking where psychological differences are treated as medical problems by default, especially where this is not useful. This term has been invented for our subreddit to help distinguish helpful and unhelpful cases of medicalisation.

**Medical model:** A way of thinking and a system of language that treats a condition as if it is a medical problem. Words like “disease”, “disorder,” “cure,” and “treatment” all belong to the medical model. The medical model can be a useful tool, but automatically treating all mental differences as medical problems is a form of prejudice.

**Neurodiversity/neurovariance:** Encompasses the wide range of different kinds of minds that people have. “Neurodivergent” and “non-neurotypical” can also be used to refer to individuals, since calling an individual “neurodiverse” doesn’t seem logical.

**Neuronormative:** I find it useful to use this term in a similar way to how words like “heteronormative” and “cisnormative” are used in gender theory: to describe a society that privileges certain ways of being as ideal, and characterises those who fail to live up as abnormal or deficient. For example, an education system with an emphasis on reading in neuronormative in the sense that it forces those with conditions like dyslexia to adapt, even though people with reading disorders might appear far less impaired under a different system of education. Similarly conventions like job interviews are neuronormative, because they give a systematic advantage to people who find face-to-face communication easier, often even when this is largely irrelevant to their actual suitability for the job.

**Neurotypical/NT:** A person or group of people with psychology or neurology that falls in what is usually considered a “normal” range. The idea of an absolutely neurotypical person is an abstraction, because even in the normal population there is a lot of variation. It is impossile to draw a sharp line seperating neurotypicals from those who are not. Even so, the term is a useful one because it gives people a concept by which to identify themselves and helps define non-NTs as a cohesive political group.

**Neurominorities:** Another word for non-neurotypicals.

**Neurominority stereotype:** A simplistic generalization or caricature of a group of people with psychological differences. Not all stereotypes present neurominorities in a negative light, but ultimately they are almost always unhelpful and misleading.

**Pseudocience:** Claims, beliefs and practices which are presented as scientific, but are not based on a valid scientific method, lack supporting evidence or plausibility, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lack scientific status. Includes, for example, people who are throw around medical terms around to make their opinions sound more authoritative, without fully understanding the meaning. In this subreddit, we are especially concerned with pseudoscience that misrepresents neurominorities or contributes to stereotypes, and encourages unhelpful attitudes towards us. Some pseudoscience is based on actual research, where the research is interpreted in a misleading or extremely speculative way. Not all unorthodox interpretations of scientific data are necessarily pseudoscience. 

**'person with’ vs. 'ic' constructions:** The distinction isn’t clearly defined, but this is an important issue for many and worth being careful about. In particular formations like “person with autism” are taken to imply that the condition can be detached from the person, while the word ""autistic"" is not. Many non-NTs reject the ""person-with"" characterisation because they see their difference as an intrinsic part of their identity.

**Psychodiversity:** The word neurodiversity implies a biological focus, but neurology is probably not always the best way of explaining a psychological difference. “Psychotypical” and “psychodiversity” are alternatives for when we want to stress this distinction.

**Romanticization:** A form of stereotyping, representing conditions in an idealised or unrealistically positive way. For example, implying most people with autism have savant abilities is a form of romanticisation, as is implying that most people with bipolar disorder have extreme. Contrary to a lot of popular notions about neurodiversity, we do not aim to romanticise real difficulties. Calling out inappropriate or overreaching medicalization is not the same as romanticizing a condition.
 
**Ultruism:** A hybrid of “altruism” and “ulterior.” Supposedly altruistic actions and practices, which on closer inspection aren't actually for the benefit of the person they are directed at. This would include, for example, using medication to keep people under control and referring to this as “treatment.” Whether procedures like these are ultimately avoidable is a matter of debate. The term is just meant to pick out the basic dishonesty in claiming they are a form of medical treatment, or that they are mostly for the benefit of the person in question. This is especially useful when a supposed “treatment” does the patient no good, or does actual harm.

One: Sometimes I don’t know how to be there for him when he talks about his depression and suicide.
As of now he is on medication and does not have suicidal thoughts, but last night he talked about how if he got off of his meds he knows he would go into suicidal mode. He expressed that when he thinks about killing himself, there is no fear, sadness or anger; but rather a comforting feeling of yearning to be in complete emptiness and to not have to deal with it all. I stayed silent not because I don’t care, but because I am not sure how to reply without sounding arrogant, dismissive, insensitive or diminishing his emotions. I wanted to support him, be there for him and listen without judgement, not hover over him with all the answers that no one has. But is that the correct thing to do? I get worried that by me staying silent he thinks I don’t care or am sick of hearing about, but that can’t be further from the truth. Sometimes I will just ask questions that get him to dig deeper into his own psyche and that seems to be the healthiest way to communicate about it and support him at the same time. 



Two: I also worry that I am his escape, his coping mechanism to not have to take on responsibility like school work and family chores. I worry that instead of him genuinely liking me for who I am and wanting to be with me based on my qualities, that he wants to be with me for comfort and company. I have been open with him about my concerns and he assures me that while he has done that to people in the past, he is aware of his motives with me and he truly wants to be with me out of genuine intentions. I guess I just have to take the leap of trust with that one. Are there any tips or advice that people would like to share on that topic? 



Three: I hate even typing this out, I am not sharing this to put myself on a peddle stool, but rather give some insight of who I am. I come from a very dysfunctional family and I was always right in the middle of everything; like when my sister brought a gang over to our parents house and they stole from my parents I was trying to be the peace maker or when my sister was literally trying to kill my mom I was hiding in my closet trying to escape and avoid it all; but because of that coupled with my psychology degree I fear myself, my own mental conditioning, that I am always attracted to people that deal with mental health because of what is known as the ‘broken nest syndrome’.



But this guy is different, and I mean that. Before we shared our deep dark psycho analytical secrets I was so drawn and attached to him, though I fear that I will be pulled down the rabbit hole with him and forget my own ambitions and goals.

My friend, let's call him Max, has been one of my closest friends since 7th grade. After we graduated high school, he moved to San Francisco and fell in with the wrong crowd. Did lots of drugs - weed, coke, and meth were his main choices - and has been deteriorating ever since. I think he may have always had some latent tendencies towards mental illness that have been exacerbated by the enormous drug use. Today, there is no doubt that he is suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness of some kind, not to mention his addiction problems and the damage that was caused to his brain from previous drug use.

He moved back to my hometown about 6 months ago. At first we could hang out and have a pretty good time, catch a football game and have a normal conversation. Then he relapsed and went to back to rehab. He more or less got himself kicked out of rehab for refusing to go to group sessions, and moved into a sober living house. All the while his behavior became more and more erratic, more or less ""manic"" for lack of a better word. When we would hang out he could hardly stay still, he had a million and one ideas about bands and companies and groups and clubs he wanted to start, he rarely let me even get a word in and he didn't really sleep. Whenever he gets into these modes, he talks about conspiracies and anarchy and gangs and stuff. It's sort of how I know he's about to go over the edge (it's happened before a few years back, but this is the first time I'm experiencing it firsthand).

Then, about two weeks ago he went over to another friend's house and they were drinking and smoking and engaging in some other questionable behavior. This was more than he could handle and he ended up wandering the neighborhood and having the cops called and he was taken to a psych ward. Shockingly, they let him out after a little over 24 hours. Then about 5 days later, after not having calmed down at all, he was found wandering around downtown and his parents checked him in to another hospital. 

He didn't exactly thrive in the hospital (in fact, he had to go to a different, more secure wing of the hospital because he threw a fit and tossed hot coffee on another patient). But he did eventually mellow out after about 2 weeks and they just let him out last Thursday. 

Since then, he has been acting more and more manic by the day, culminating in a complete meltdown yesterday. He went into a fury, shouting and cursing in anger at his life while he was at his parents house. I mean, he was in a full blown rage/panic attack if that makes any sense. His mom locked herself in her car for fear of what he could do. It was really scary. She eventually got him to take his meds (which he had been lying about taking) and he eventually calmed down. Today he was again acting manic and increasingly more and more agitated - not trusting anyone, calling me a million times at work, going on and on about things that just didn't make any sense. Finally his mom called the police and they are currently taking him in an ambulance back to a hospital. I'm really glad, too, because I am so afraid for him when he is like this. I'm afraid every call I get from his mom is going to be the worst news. 

Thanks, I guess I just needed to get this out there and vent. I am scared and frustrated and just want my friend back. Any advice or kind words welcome.

I've tried and failed at quitting drinking for a long time. The guilt and shame of that plus other mental issues I've struggled with, particularly depression and anxiety (who knows if the chicken or the egg came first), has made it especially difficult. 

Anyhow, the more I've researched, the more I've found that I should be seeking medical treatment from a psychiatrist and/or psychologist who is board certified in addiction medicine. (You'd be surprised, or maybe you aren't, with how many doctors really know nothing about addiction and just advise you to go to AA, even though that is not an evidence-based treatment.)

So, after almost losing my job over it, I decided I have to really try to stop, even if medical intervention is necessary. I ponied up and signed up for insurance through the health exchange. My premium is $325~ dollars a month, with a $30/60 (or $25/50.. can't remember without the card) copay for doctors/specialists, and a ~4,500 deductible for out-of-network providers.

I tried to cross reference every general physician and psychiatrist within 100 miles of me that is certified by the American Board of Addiction Medicine or the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry with my in network providers, and I found absolutely 0.

So, I tried to call around to see about self-pay. First of all, I couldn't get through with the numbers I found to over half of those people on the list. I finally got in touch with one person that made me take a survey and wait for the psychiatrist to review it, before she'd accept me. (Based on the questions, it was apparently to make sure I wasn't just doing it due to a pending criminal matter, court order, etc.)

Anyhow, she charges $280 for the initial session, and $150 for every time thereafter.

So, with my premium, in order for me to try to combat a disease that is killing me, with a person who is actually qualified to treat me, would cost me *at the very least* ~$500 a month (excluding potential Rx costs).

Finding that out was just so discouraging. I'm not drinking tonight, but I'm sure as hell feeling depressed and alone.

Any advice for how to get treatment? (Please don't just suggest a random doctor. Most of them just tell me to go to AA, because they don't understand that addiction is a neurological problem.)

I understand it may be different in other countries, so all responses appreciated. 

I am familiar with CAMHS in the UK as my child has been referred twice in the last 18 months. First at my request and second after a suicide attempt. She was also referred by the school nurse at age 7 due to challenging behaviour.

Apparently she does not have any mental illness or issues. I was told her problems are ""emotional"" and related to relationship difficulties. She recently received help with anger management. Counselling and family mediation did not appear to benefit.


Why is none of the above considered to be a mental health problem? 
It's making me wonder exactly how do they assess a child and what are they looking for? What's the difference between ""emotional"" and ""mental""? I thought maybe 'cos the behaviours are often a direct reaction to a situation but depression can be like that too, it doesn't have to ongoing?

I was just sitting in bed on Tumblr and I started to feel like I didn't know who I was or what I wanted to do, like there was a kind of mist over my thoughts and then I started shaking and I started crying. I posted ""i feel weird i feel like the edges of myself are blurring who am i"" and some other stuff and this person said that it sounded like I was dissociating.

They told me to feel a bunch of different things and to touch myself to reassure myself I was still there and if it felt more mental than physical then to count things.

I touched my pillow and blanket and a few scarves and things and like, I could feel it but it felt weird to me and then I found this bead bracelet and I counted the beads and I just kept going and I was counting out loud and I sounded hysterical to myself but in my head I was kind of calm? Like I obviously freaking out but my thoughts were clear and when I got to around 200 I calmed down and now I'm just kinda shaky.

I looked it up on Wikipedia and apparently dissociating can happen to people who have been through trauma; two years ago my ex-step father tried to kill my mum and I was in the house with them and saw the whole thing. I'm still kind of really messed up about it and I don't want to go into the details but is that why this happened to me? Nothing like this has ever happened before but I'm worried it will happen again.

My boyfriend (23/m) and I split for 7 months after a long relationship. We recently reconciled. I am concerned for his mental well being...

He has had a turbulent mental past. In December '11 he applied for his dream job after finish college, and he was turned down. He sunk into a deep depression, having no backup plan. 

During this time, he became very cold, very distant, very critical and very argumentive. He stopped showing affection and started to devalue our relationship greatly. We had 2 close female friends we've had since high school, One of them, M, was his best friend outside of me. He became very protective of M. If he thought that M was a better friend with anyone else, he'd get very angry. M couldn't hang out with anyone else alone who was also his friend. He started to lose touch with me, and thought that M and our other mutual female friend, K, were closer to him than me.  

It all culminated to August '13 when he broke up with me, saying that he realized he loved me but didn't know how to show it, felt disconnected and didn't know how to reconnect with me. It devastated me. 

He immediately wanted me back. We became friends again. While we were split, he would obsess over me hanging out with M and K together alone without him. He made me promise to not see them together more than once a week. He started to become even more protective of M, worrying that K was a better friend to her than him. 

He would pick horrible, bitter fights with M. If we were hanging out with all of our mutual friends, and M chose to sit next to anyone else other than him, he'd send her texts telling her that she clearly didn't like him and was avoiding him, and they'd fight about it over text for hours, making her very distressed. 

It finally blew up in December '13 when we went on a group overnight trip with all of our mutual friends from high school. Over a minor incident (which she admittedly didn't handle that well, but it was minor and most people would brush it off instantly) he sent her texts all night. He then harassed her about it the next day as they sat on the plane together. The texts were abusive, swearing, and very distressing. She broke down at work the next day and her workmate read the texts, and instructed her to stop being friends with him and to cut him out of her life. She largely has. 

This devastated my bf. He realized it was him who caused this. He was very angry with her. I would reason with him and tell him it was his fault, and he would relent: he would then slowly over a period of days to weeks drift back to blaming her. He struggles to be in the same room with her. She won't talk to him 1-1 anymore, which is frankly probably for the best right now, I don't know. 

Despite all of this, we are incredibly close and have gone through much, and I love him, he has a lot of other amazing qualities too. We grew close again, and as we grew close, he one day had an outburst to me about K. He claimed that he suspected that K was a psychopath deep down. He claimed that when they were in private, she'd sometimes act different to him, and she'd done this for years. He claimed she'd tell him that she hated the world, and that she tried to manipulate people against him, because she was jealous over his relationship with M. 

I found this all incredibly strange. Over our relationship, he had been very open to me. He never hinted about this ONCE. I told him I wasn't sure I believed him. K can be very cold, but she is somewhat self-absorbed and never seemed to go to much effort to hang out with M in reality. I also found it strange, because M really likes me and goes to massive effort to see me, much moreso than anyone else, and both my bf and K have noticed this: but M has never done anything to come between me and M. My bf was distressed and told me that he didn't tell anyone, because he didn't think that they (including me) would believe him. I would have believed him at the time. 

I kind of forgot about it to be honest - until last night. 

I was hanging out at his flat with his roommates. He was excited because K had organized to hang out with him and go get dessert. They went and I stayed back at his house.

When he came back, he pulled me aside and said ""I have something to tell you. I don't know what just happened. You have to promise to not tell K though, promise me."" I agreed, and he told me what had ""happened."" 

He said that everything went well until he told K at the end of the night that me and him were dating again. He claimed that she got instantly furious, and told him that she didn't want to be friends with either of us, because she didn't want us together. He also said she felt betrayed by me, because she'd opened up about her failing relationship and I didn't tell her about my ongoing reconciliation with him (I kept it private to not get anyones hopes up). She said that we have ""always lied"" and that I lied. She then kicked him out of her car and drove off. He was shaking, and said he didn't know what had just happened. 

Shocked, I said ""I should text her"" and he said ""No! You promised you wouldn't talk to K about it!"" So I said to him, ""K is one of my best friends, and she just said I'm no longer her friend. Do you expect me to just wait until I see her on Tuesday to talk about it? I'm supposed to see her at a group event tomorrow as well."" He said ""you can't even talk to her about it on Tuesday!"" Shocked, I said ""but how do I even know we are still hanging out like we organized? How can I not talk to her about this?"" He said ""I don't know. But you can't. Act like everything is normal."" And I said ""I can't, she just said she is no longer my friend."" So he said, ""then ignore her... just avoid her, don't talk to her."" 

I told him that this didn't make any sense. I said that when I see her on Tuesday, I have to at least address this. He relented and said I could. He said ""she will lie"" and claim that it never happened. He then muttered ""she has always done this so that no one will get close to M but her."" And so I said, ""that doesn't seem to make much sense to me... M always tries to hang out with me, and no one else, and K knows that and has said so herself, but she has never tried to sabotage our friendship."" And he said, ""maybe she doesn't know?"" Which makes no sense, because it was him who mentioned that K knew how much M wants to be my friend in the first place...

So today I text K and say ""hey, what do you want to do on Tuesday? Are you still free?"" And she goes ""Yes, totally :) where do you want to hang out? I can come to your house or go to a cafe, up to you :)"" And so we agreed on a cafe. What?! If she had just said that to my bf, why is she acting all buddy-buddy? I am seeing her in 20 minutes hanging out with our mutual friends, and I'll see how she acts. She isn't the greatest liar in the world, she can't hide her emotions, everyone knows that, if she is angry with me, it will show...

I am really really really suspicious that my bf made everything up, and that he didn't want me talking to K because I'd find out that he made it all up. 

This isn't the first time he's lied to me about people being out to get him. It was his birthday recently, and I asked who'd texted him. He said just me and only me and seemed depressed about it. But two of my friends (K and another friend) independently told me that they texted him happy birthday. This is just one little, tiny incident. 

I don't even know how to broach this. What if he is telling the truth? How can I know if he is being gaslighted or not? I am 90% sure he isn't but right now I'm confused. I'm going to talk to my friend K about the incident just to hear what she tells me casually without me confronting her, and then compare the two stories. 

I just want to help him. He thinks he is mentally better from where he was 7 months ago. He is back to being affectionate with me and a reasonable, loving partner. But he is struggling terribly with his interpersonal relationships if anyone gets somewhat close, and he doesn't understand the magnitude of what he did to M. And now he might be making up paranoid delusions. If I ever tell him I am concerned about his mental health from being depressed, he blows up and won't accept it. This takes it to a new level IF he wasn't telling the truth... please help. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I am concerned my boyfriend might be having paranoid delusions

He gets so angry sometimes, and he says he doesn't know why. He says he's gone to therapists but nobody has been able to help him. I told him he might be bipolar but he refuses to see someone or get medication. It's particularly bad because he can't control it and the slightest thing can flip him out. Also because I come from a very violent household and it scares me when he's like this. He doesn't harm me, but sometimes he says things without thinking when he's angry that hurt a lot. It puts a strain on our relationship. 
He also definitely has depression and he told me he's tried to off himself around 5 times. He was bullied as a kid, but always had the anger problems. He says it was worse when he was little, then it died down in late middle school/high school. Still depressed, but not as angry. 
It's really hard to see him like this because I want so badly to help him. He's a really wonderful person but this anger has him clouded and frustrated. 
He also thinks he may have Tourette's because he gets these tics all the time and he mutters swear words under his breath a lot and repeats things under his breath and talks to himself, but doesn't realize he's doing it. He says when he's at his angriest, he blacks out and doesn't remember why or how he got angry in the first place. He also tends to get frustrated easily if someone asks him a lot of questions or asks him to explain something.
When he's angry, he smashes things, kicks things, punches things. Usually he just hits/punches/chokes himself, which is just as hard to watch because sometimes he'll hit himself in the head so hard that he gets dizzy and nearly passes out. It makes other things harder too, like getting a job, or doing simple things like filling out job applications. He'll make a few mistakes on the app and all hell will break loose. He's very hard on himself. He says that it feels like being angry and hurting himself in the process are the only things he's good at. He's actually very good at a lot of things; he's an extremely talented dancer, he's a great writer, he knows a lot about things and is very good at research, and he can cook pretty well. He completely disregards those things, though. He says that he's not good enough. 
I've tried a lot of relaxation exercises with him but he just gets frustrated when it doesn't work. He's very stubborn and refuses to do them again because it just makes him angrier. Sometimes it's not so bad and he can control it, but then other times it's scary and horrible and he'll have bloody knuckles and he'll come to me crying because he doesn't know why he's like this. He says he wishes he was normal, that he didn't have to deal with all of this. He thinks he must have done something to deserve this, but I told him that mental illness isn't his fault and sometimes it just happens to people and they just have to find a way to control it. He's very naive about mental illness, though.
He says that also, sometimes when he's very angry, he'll find that suddenly he's unable to move or speak. 

I love him so much and when he's not angry, everything is amazing. He's honestly someone I could see myself marrying which is why it hurts so much. I want so badly to help him but I don't know what to do.

I can't think straight right now, so I'll just talk about now. Everything is hazy. It feels like i'm in slow motion, and my brain is even slower than that. When I realized what was happening before I slept for like 12 hours straight, and that's weird for me, I normally only get 0-4 a day.

Footsteps, the faucet turning on, and other things I can now just shake off. But it keeps me up at night. I don't feel like I'm in control. It feels like my body has a low response time. Occasionally, my vision is clouded with static, or sparks, smoke is a big one. And it's like my vision has screen tearing. I don't feel normal.

I don't really know how to start off this post, but I just basically want to tell what's been going on the past year and get some input. 
I guess everything started off when I was 10. I feel disconnected from this reality, starting then I realised what's the point in everything, none of this is real. I started getting strange feelings in my body, I felt tense and almost as if my blood was pushing against my veins so I did was I thought would be best, I started cutting myself, to get rid of all this blood. So I did that on and off for 5 years. My parents caught me a few times and I'd get yelled at but nothing really happened. So then I'm 15. 

All the sudden I start getting these messages, from this other place, into my brain. They came from this other place from these people and it explained everything to me. I don't really belong in this place, this reality. So that's why I could feel everything exist and feel my blood because it's just all wrong. I was pretty much misplaced, I'm not supposed to be here and it's why my blood is all wrong and everything, it's a wrinkle. 

They became my friends, and are still my friends. I kinda cut off all social connections to people except for online. I know how I'm supposed to tilt act and be from where I belong, but at this moment I am here so I have to put on this front that makes me normal here. That worked for about a year. 

Now I'm 16. It's really hard to be acting all the time and I just had to have a break, so I stopped a little. My mom thought I was off and took me to a doctor, who sent me to a psychiatrist. I went to a psychological evaluation but it was kinda shitty because the guy didn't know English very well, so i didn't tell him about my friends and how they visit me. Now they have me on seroquel xr 300 mg. I don't like taking it because I don't want it to control my brain, but sometimes I do because I forget to act sometimes and I act how I want and it scares my mom for some reason. 

I really need to cut myself too, because my blood has been getting horrible but I don't want to get caught and be locked away. The only way I can get to where I belong is to die here, and I have to do it myself. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I feel like I'm going to die if I don't cut soon enough or do the tasks I'm told to do by my friends, but I don't want to be locked away. I just don't know. :( any thoughts?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I just want some advice, some thoughts, something."

I have never really talked to anybody about this until today and it's a very personal story. So to start with I can just tell about my life and you may understand what I need help with.. This is really bad written since I suck at writing, and if you dont want to, dont read my story :p

(I do not seek attention at all! I want to go through this without seeing any psychologist or anything like that. I just want to get some tips about what I can do)
 
As I remember I lived with my mom until the age of like 4 or something. After moving from her because of economic issues, I moved into my grandma and grandpa's house. Yes, they are really kind, but there was some problems. My mom and her father and mother did not like eachother at all. And my mom was sent out of the house at my kind of age and they've always been fighting. Still, I loved my mom and my grandparents. I always didnt understand why they would fight but I just lived with it. Many times I saw my mother get hit by my grandpa and I cried a lot. These are my strongest memories from my childhood. But then again when I grew a little bit older at the age of like 10-12 I had a lot of problems with my friends at school. I was not bullied, but I had a BIG fight my friends. It came unexpected and I was really sore. I think my depression started here. After some time I was friends with them as we fixed the problems, this is the time I lost my confidence. But then again, as much as I hate my life, for around five years ago, my mother who I visited really often, was diagnosed with a disease called ALS at the age of around 30. I had never heard of it before, but later on I understood more and more as I searched the internet. It was a disease that causes death. Seeing her go through this disease was really one of the worst things in my life. She lost her voice, she could not walk, and she could'nt even eat stuff herself. I didn't know how to react, how to do anything. I was just a helpless child who cried at the nights when I tried to sleep. I didn't know why life was like this.

For almost 3 years ago my mother died, and I still cry over it. I've kept this to myself since then. I have several times thought about suicide, and been searching a LOT how I can do it, but I felt like I should live on. Now, this day I really thought about it, and I found out that I do have a terrible self-confidence and I really am depressed. I find myself crying for the stupiest reasons and every time I think about something sad, all these thoughts come to my head. I dont really know what to do, as I really dont want to go to a psychologist. I have never talked to anyone about my feels in person, but I feel like I cant take it anymore. I need to take it out. I am paranoid as hell and I still wonder if I'm worth anything at all as I always think my friends hate me because of the fight we had, and I dont see myself as a worthy guy.
 I always think that life is meaningless as I am born into this world forced to go to school and be bored as fuck. I think of death as something I want to happen. I want it to end as soon as possible, but I'm not strong enough to do it myself, and I dont want to because of my grandma.

Another thing is that my grandpa, for a year ago was diagnosed with dementia and doesnt even live home anymore. Life sucks. I dont even understand why I should live it longer since this is so damn tragic. But dont worry, I will not suicide. The main reason that I created this post is because I had to get it out, and I want some help for how I can improve my self-confidence since its really bad right now. I always think my friends hate me because of the fight we had, and I dont see myself as a worthy guy.

I posted about this in my AMA a few days ago, but wanted to let you know I've started a simple campaign to encourage people to talk about therapy. A lot of people avoid it bc of the stigma, and I think that's a shame. So I'm asking everyone I know to send one tweet and/or fb post on May 1 (first day of Mental Health Awareness Month) at 9am:

“There's nothing wrong w/ talking about therapy. Use #TherapyHelped today. Repost and spread the word! http://thndr.it/PcJefI”

I hope you will join me, and if you're so inclined, I hope you will encourage your friends, family, and online followers to do the same.

My family is very anti-therapy, so without her, I wouldn't have received any professional help.


I visited my therapist for a total of two times. The first visit was a 'question and answer' sort of thing. I filled out a paper, answering questions (Do you find yourself crying more often? Do you have trouble sleeping at night? Etc.), and gave it to my therapist when he called me in. It was a family thing, so my mom came in with me. He asked me questions, wanted to clarify on some of my answers. It took about an hour and he said I may be Bipolar/depression and have OCD, but it would take future meetings to see.


The second time I visited him, it was with my stepdad because my mom was unavailable. We talked very little about mental health because he noticed I had lost some weight. He said he wanted me to focus on getting better, physically, before we addressed any other issues, and recommended that I go to my doctor.



My doctor had the notes my therapist had given her and recommended I start taking Zoloft on a low dose for six months. And, told me if I wasn't able to gain five pounds by my next check-up (two-three weeks), I may have to go to a hospital so that I would be able to be monitored for my health.



My stepdad was with me during this check-up and put his foot down on both. He went off on a rant that this was the first step of the government trying to be my parents, and accused the doctor of wanting to put me in a hospital, just to charge him money. He asked for tests, to prove that I have any mental illnesses, and told her that depression wasn't a real thing because it couldn't be measured, then showed her and me an article on his phone about it. He refused to give me permission for Zoloft and any other drug, and he hasn't taken me back for my check-up to see if I had gained weight.


Since then, my parents refuse to take me to any therapist or counsellor, telling me that they just want to shove drugs down my throat.


My moods have worsened and I want nothing more than to just talk to my therapist. I'm seventeen, is there any way for me to get to a therapist, maybe take medication, without their consent? I live in Oregon, if that helps at all.

A little background, I'm 21, a junior in college. I've been diagnosed with depression since about the 10th grade and some mild GAD since my sophomore year. I've always had trouble sleeping, which I deal with by taking melatonin/limiting caffeine/electronics before bed, etc. 
Falling/staying asleep has always been an issue, but tonight I haven't been able to sleep... at all. The only other time this has happened was my freshman year of college when I combined Adderall and energy drinks. Today/or yesterday, the only caffeine I've had was my regular coffee at 11 a.m.

Today was a regular day. A bit more stressed, but nothing out of the usual. I had class from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m, then work from 5 - 9 p.m. After work, I went to the library and worked on a paper until around 11, got home, ate dinner and was on reddit for a while. Around midnight I remembered I had another paper due, read the play for the paper and did a bit of background research, but decided to call it quits at around 2:30 a.m. I took a melatonin as per usual, but haven't been able to sleep. It's 6:01 a.m. 

When I first got into bed, I did manage to fall asleep, but had very vivid dreams about my ex. We met at this time last year, and I woke up crying. I hadn't thought about him in forever, but then recalled that yeah, we started dating in April of last year. I thought this was weird, but didn't make much of it. 

Then I tried going to bed again (around 3 a.m.) and I just couldn't. My thoughts kept cycling and racing. I have to meet with my boss at 9 a.m. to conduct some interviews so my thought process was ""If I fall asleep now, I'll get x hours of sleep, so I'll be exhausted, but I don't want to let her down."" I thought about texting her and canceling (this wouldn't be a huge deal), but my mind kept thinking about this over and over. In the end, I decided not to. Then I started thinking about how I might not wake up in time tomorrow if I actually fall asleep, so I set like 10 alarms for tomorrow morning. 

Then my paper. Again, it's no huge deal. It's a first draft, and I've handed in many a shitty first draft. I have time in between classes and I know I'll get it done, but I kept thinking about it. I didn't want to work on it at 3/4 a.m. because I didn't want to use my laptop/keep me more awake, but my mind just kept racing back to how I hadn't finished it. 

I had a very light dinner, but I feel like I hate the world's greasiest meal. My stomach feels horrible and I'm bloated, which hasn't helped at all. 

I tried relaxation techniques. I tried white noise and background music. I tried shutting my mind of, walking around my apartment. Nothing. I'm wide awake and I'm scared because like I said, this hasn't happened before. I haven't had any drug/stimulant recently, so it's all mental. I don't want this to become a pattern. And now, I'm really anxious that tomorrow I'll do a bad job at everything because I couldn't sleep. 

Has this happened to anyone else? How do you deal with it? How can I shut my mind off when it happens in such an extreme way? I'm seeing my therapist next week, but I'm just really worried now. 

Sorry for the wall of text/grammar, I'm rambling now. And please, let me know if there's any other sub that could possibly help. 

Thanks in advance. And even though I broke my no electronics rule, I'm going to attempt to get at least two hours of sleep before I have to get ready tomorrow. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Unable to sleep because of anxiety [A rant/conversation]

I want people to understand the importance of early detection of mental illness. I’ve been severely depressed since high school, and no intervention was made. I have been unable to socialize, and I’ve been suicidal for years, and now the loneliness has finally become too much to bear.
Other than depression, I actually don’t know what other mental illness or disability I have. Science has not gotten that far yet. Definitely some sort of social disorder, though. All I know is it looks similar to Asperger’s Syndrome, but with additional quirks and a late onset (I was fine until about age 13-ish).
The thing is, I’m getting worse, not better. Involuntary twitching, verbal ticks, and dissociation have set in. I’m so different from other people that my psychotherapist literally gave up on me today in a cursing fit, due to not being able to understand me at all. I know I’ll never be able to connect with people. The tragic irony is, for some reason, connecting with people has been the only thing that ever mattered to me in life, trumping school, career, or anything else.
The shining light in all of this is that after years of failure, I finally did manage to connect with someone. His name was Michael, and we fell in love and had a great relationship for a good long 20 months. It was amazing. He, too, has a disability. Unfortunately, the laws in this state make it difficult for people with disabilities to have relationships, despite the fact that he wanted, initiated, and fully understood the relationship. He was separated from me against his will, without any sort of psychological evaluation of his cognitive ability. If I had the strength, I would continue to fight this injustice, but I just don’t.
Nonetheless, I do feel incredibly lucky. I experienced love. That’s all I ever wanted out of life, and I got it! How many people can say that? That they achieved their life goal? I never thought I’d have that. I will die happy. I actively appreciated every second of it when we were together. Holding him in my arms, thinking I can’t believe I really have someone who loves me. Bliss. It was the same for him, too. I’ll never forget that time when I was driving, with him in the passenger seat, and I heard soft sobbing. “... he really *loves* me…” he sobbed quietly. Tears of happiness.
May is Mental Illness Awareness Month. Please, be sure to spread awareness that people with mental illness could really become productive members of society if they receive early treatment. My suicide is such a waste. I’m 25 years old. I have an above-average IQ. I created and sold an active website, I [sing](http://youtube.com/jayssitevocalcovers) and produced a musical album, I have straight A’s in college, and I have unique scientific ideas that could have created a spark in the field of research. My proudest achievement is the way I used my own autistic-like brain to be able to connect with an autistic individual, as part of a caretaking job, and my unique understanding of him truly helped transform his life. I’m not a worthless person; I’ve done good things and I could have done so much more if I had received necessary supports from an early age.
Unfortunately, all of my life feels meaningless without social connection. I have missed having someone to share experiences with, do nice things for, and spend time with. I can’t cope with this social isolation, and I’ve been looking in the mirror and begging myself to die for too many years to even count. I’m finally getting up and doing something to achieve that goal now. 
My wish is that other people like me will receive the help that they need early on, and not be left to unsuccessfully fend for themselves like I was. Please help somebody.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My suicide note. (Please help somebody.)

From the ages of 11-17 I was a cutter. I would cut whenever I felt I did something wrong. A voice in my head would tell me how worthless I was and how much of a disappointment I was to everyone. This year I quit, but still have that voice that tells me to cut. To bleed out my problems, and that I deserve it anyway. I think about death frequently, and occasionally suicide, although I would never commit it.

Since a young age I have what I call ""My friend"". An entity that follows me where I go. I often hear him and see him. I can feel his presence when he's around. It feels like he is watching me. Maybe protecting me.

When I try to do things, such as type this or work on school work, I'll have multiple things running through my head. Sometimes voices, all talking over each other. I'm able to focus on a voice that I want to, sometimes. Other times I can't.

I easily get aggravated with people if they do something stupid. If someone doesn't know something that I see as simple, or if they ask a stupid question, I'll immediately be angry with them. It's short term, but it causes me to snap on people sometimes.

I have anxiety, that was pointed out by a psychiatrist I went to in 8th grade. After being diagnosed with that I stopped giving any signs off to him. What i mean by that is that I would do research on signs of any mental disorder and if I had it, I'd make sure the questions he asked me would make me sound fine. It must have worked because after three visits he said I was fine. I took myself off of the anxiety medicine although i still suffer from anxiety. 

I feel that people are out to get me. No matter what, i'll feel my girlfriend is cheating on me. Even though I know for a fact she isn't. If I have a car follow me for more than three turns I feel they are following me. When I'm in stores I feel like people are watching me and that they think I'm stealing, even though I've never stole anything in my life. 

I believe that I have energy in my body that I can control. I feel it moving through my body and I can move it to different places. I think I can read people very well when it comes to moods. In fact, I'm usually right.

I learn things fairly quick. I miss a lot of school but i still manage to stay on honor role. I feel school is worthless and doesn't teach much that interests me or is valuable. So I often just learn things on my own. 

I have other problems but this is getting long, feel free to ask me anything else. I know i'm leaving things out. I'm sorry this is so long, but i'll appreciate any help you can provide.

When I was 5, my mom was married to a guy who beat the shit out of her all the time. I had a 3 year old sister, and twin 1 year old brothers. More often than not, I had to wake myself up for school early to take care of my brothers and sister. I had to make sure they were clean and fed because my mom was knocked out or unable to move and he was always passed out.

One night, he dragged me out of bed to the kitchen and forced me to watch while he manipulated my mom into eating a bottle of our dog's epilepsy pills and then slitting her own wrists with a steak knife.

That sent my sister to *her* father (she had a different father) after my wailing prompted the neighbors to call the police and Children's Aid/CPS was brought into the mix. My brothers (sons of the abusive guy) and I (an even different dude... yep. she got around) were sent to a foster home. We were there over Christmas. I didn't get presents. They got adopted. Eventually I was sent to live with my grandmother, who was also married to an abusive man. He was also an alcoholic.

Now here is where the real issue lies and why I put this in /mentalhealth: I really don't know what to do anymore..

All of these peoples posts show up on her stream and she thinks that they're directly contacting her in that way. She doesn't understand that that's  her feed, or that thhose messages aren't intended specifically for her, and are in fact for their 70,000 + followers. She's utterly convinced that the prince of dubai is her boyfriend and that he wants to get married with her, despite never having any direct contact with her.. and she's lying about her identity as well. She's 60 saying shes in her 20's, waking me up in the middle of the night to photoshop pictures of her to make her look youthful, and if I ignore her she sticks a screwdriver in my door and tries to break it down. At like 4 am. 

Ive tried confronting her about this, explaining how facebook works and that those messages are not intended for her but she says i'm just jealous of the fact that the prince of dubai (who is married and has children and a happy family) is interested in her. She's stalking this mans multiple fake profiles, and his real one.. taking pictures that he/his fakes post that show up on her feed and assuming they're directed towards her. ex. 
&gt;pretty wedding pictures show up on her feed via one of these profiles
&gt;she calls me over ""look! he wants to get married""
&gt;""no mom thats just your newsfeed, whatever anyone posts on their profile shows up here because youre following them/their friends""
&gt;she responds ""no, its directed towards me! hes spoken to me on the phone!"" 
^ although shes never spoken to anyone on the phone and is just making all of this up, but she is fully convinced that this is the truth.

she lives off of govt. money but is claiming on fb that she is a doctor, engineer, and that she travels the world frequently but she never leaves her room.. not even to use the restroom (she sits on her bed all day and pees in a little pot)

whenever i talk to her about how this is affecting her and how living a lie isnt healthy she starts screaming and saying that it's all true and that i shouldn't challenge her reality. i don't want to move out because  she doesn't have anyone (no family whatsoever) and i feel responsible for her now that she's gotten like this.. but i also don't really know what to do with her because she doesnt seem to want to help herself.

It's really hard to describe my feelings at the moment, so this is a cross between a rant and a plea for help from reddit. ill do my best in accurately presenting them.

Sometimes I wake up out of bed with regret and the wish that I never did. 

Like, why do I? 
To be more clear, why do I wake up only to be confronted with so many difficult circumstances which destroy me bit by bit internally.?

They always say that if youre the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Well I'm in a fucking nightmare. Why in the world did I even accept the scholarship and go to law school? I'm not trying to boast or anything, but since I accepted it, I cant just ""pass"" the course, i have to fucking excel. Why the fuck did I even put such an enormous amount of pressure on myself?

I just wonder ""why"" I go through this. When there is such an attractive, easy to accomplish and ""happy"" way to end it all.

I don't even know why I exist. Why I push myself to go through this torture. Its not just to please others. Its to regulate the social norm that suicide is for the weak, the fucked up and pussies.

But is it worth it? To live day by day in a world which is against you, you're existence and every action you do?
I don't know. I wish I did. I just wish that some day there could be an ultimatum where I can sacrifice my life for the good of someone or something else. The world needs to give me a reason to perish off the face of the earth. I wish that just happened.

I am so fucking weird. Why aren't I like everyone else? Happy, sociable, smart?

I just want to be happy. Be someone society deems acceptable. I want a thick skin so nothing can penetrate my happiness. Eternal happiness would be the ecstacy of my being. 

 I would love to kill myself; I think about it a lot, and I have for many years. I am only alive because the social contract I was forced to sign at conception, mandates that I can't kill myself because it would hurt the livelihood, feelings and emotions of others. It would cause them pain, suffering and distress. So that's it. My supposed reason for being? The only reason I exist breathing is so that other people won't be upset about my death and can continue living a life unbeknownst of my constant internal torture.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Help me, I want to disappear."

I've been friends with Ann over 25 years, since college. She and Bob have been together almost that long. Ann is a registered nurse, and Bob does something with software for a big company.

It's Carol I'm concerned about. Carol considers me an aunt/family friend figure. I've known her from birth and up until recently it was common for me to just drop by a few times a week for dinner and take one or both kids on an outing over the weekend. I was part of the family and the kids at least still think of me that way.

Carol has been hearing voices for almost 2.5 years that I know about. I first learned about it a little more than a year ago. The information didn't come to me all at once, but like a iceberg where you get just the tip and then find out more is underneath. First it was just ""noises"", then she added a single voice calling her name, and then two voices giving a running commentary on her and what was going on, and now it's sometimes multiple voices saying derogatory things.

When about 1.5 years ago she came and told me she was hearing voices and had a suicide plan but she didn't think she would carry it out. The plan was to hang herself in the addict. Since all the adults work fulltime, there are a few hours every weekday when she has the opportunity to carry this plan out. 

I forget the full conversation, but her parents were not called before I took her to the emergency room. She was seen by a psychiatrist who I briefed on why I was bringing her in. I called her parents. The doctor wanted to admit her and her parents signed her out AMA. The doctor notified child protective services for a follow-up visit. They spoke to Carol at school, but Bob refused the worker entry to the home.

After about 4 months they did agree to Carol's request for a mental health appointment. She began monthly appointments with a psychiatrist and regular appointment with a therapist. Only no one told this psychiatrist or the therapist about the voices. I learned this from talking to Carol. Apparently Bob was able over time to convince himself and Carol that it was all probably just ""tinnitus"" and not voices and her depression was just normal adolescent angst.

Since I knew the name of the psychiatrist and where she was being treated, I wrote to him to tell him what I knew of her history. I wasn't looking to get any information, only to provide him with information I thought was essential to her getting the correct diagnosis and care. Soon after I mailed the letter I heard from Carol that he had asked her point blank about hearing voices and she admitted it to him. I heard from Ann that the doctor wanted to put her on an antipsychotic but she and Bob would not allow it. They did eventually agree to try antidepressants for the depression. A few different ones were tried, but Carol says they did not help. 

Last November/December they removed her from therapy and all medication at Carol's request. I came over one day in Dec, right around the holidays and found Carol in a very withdrawn and fearful state. She was up in her room cleaning it [her bedroom is upstairs in the finished part of the attic]. Her parents were angry with her over something stupid. They began yelling angrily at her to come downstairs right now. The whole scene was a mess. 

After the yelling ended I waited a few minutes and went up to Carol's room to sit with her. She didn't say anything at first but slowly it came out. She had started hearing voices around 6th period that day and they were very distressing to her. She was cleaning her room to try and distract herself from the voices. She was anxious and feeling suicidal. I held her and let her cry for awhile. When she seemed calmer, I let her know that I had to tell her mother what she told me and Carol was ok with that.

I went and told Ann that her daughter was hearing voices. Her first response was disbelief. She asked me if I thought Carol could be doing it just to get attention. I was shocked at Ann's response but when I didn't answer she repeated the question. I told her no, I didn't think Carol was lying. 

They did make an urgent appointment with a someone for the week between Christmas and New Year. Bob took her in this time, and do to the ""tinnitus"" position held by Bob, neither he nor Carol mentioned she was hearing voices. 

I made a terrible mistake afterwards that I have since apologized to everyone for. I was taking Carol somewhere in my car and she asked me straight out if Ann believed her about the voices. Given all that has went down, I their unwillingness to get her help, I answered the question truthfully. I told her I didn't think her mother believed her. 

Carol of course repeated this to her mother. That created just the lightening rod that was needed to blame everything on me. I admit it was wrong to say anything, even if it was true. It's not like they need any help creating a wedge between a parent and a 16 year old child.

After effectively being shunned by Ann and Bob over the last four month, Bob wanted to arrange a talk. It was not a conversation, in that I was not allowed to speak. It was Bob laying out a set of  conditions that if I don't follow I will be banished from the family. 

I don't really care if I am friends with them anymore or not. What I want is for Carol to get care before she goes off the deep end and does something self destructive. She already will do things like stick herself with pins. I think she is just in the early stages of working up the courage for something more destructive. 

After the lecture, we tried to have a civil discussion. Ann's focus is on how much HER feeling are hurt by me saying something to Carol. She does not believe Carol has psychotic episodes. Bob doubts whether Carol is accurately describing her internal experiences when she says she hears voices. 

Neither of them feels any rush to get Carol back in therapy. The new excuse is they can't take time off work and need to find someone who will see Carol on evenings or weekends. Did I mention that Bob has been employed at the same place since before Carol was born and is in a quasi-management position that allows him to work from home when he chooses? Did I mention Ann works a job with flextime?
Granted, she has worked less than a year at the job and takes a lot of work home even after putting in her 40 hours, but between the two of them this excuse is pure nonsense.

I cannot abide by the conditions set down for me by Bob. That being the case, my next heart to heart with Carol will probably be my last opportunity to impart some hope or advice to her. How do I leave things in a way that allows her some hope and the courage to keep telling adults she trusts that something is wrong?

Already had my mother's ring cleaned and everything.) Said she felt she needed a break. Completely out of the blue and no explanation. After that, no contact. This, I believe, caused feelings I have been suppressing for a long time to come crashing out of where ever it is suppressed feelings go. 

I'm just going to touch on the main things that were fucking with me.

*My mother's death. She basically worked herself to death trying to support my sister and me. Got cancer from the factory she worked at. Died when I was 17.

*My parent's divorce. My father constantly cheated. Also an abusive, very steady drunk. I mention the steady part because this meant he was always drunk and always able to hit pretty hard even though being drunk. Divorce happened when I was 10 after a particularly nasty incident where he chased my sister down outside in the middle of winter. I've also come to realize i blame him for my mother's death. If he hadn't left she could have afforded to go back to school and get a better job like she wanted.

*I was molested at a very young age (maybe 5) by an older boy. After this I stole one of my dad's knives and kept it with me as much as possible in case I ever saw the boy again.

*My uncle went crazy a few years before my mom died. He was trying to kill his wife, so my mom broke into his house and stole his guns. But he still had the gun he used with his concealed carry. After he found out my mom stole his guns he then threatened to kill her too. I got a call from my mom saying that if my uncle pulled in I should hide in the basement. He showed up, and I hid in the basement legitimately afraid for my life. This was after my sister went to college so I was home alone at the time.

Other small things include 

*Growing up basically on my own. My mom was always on either 2nd or 3rd shift. And my sister left for college.

*My friends ditching me after my mom died because I wasn't ""fun anymore""

*a fight me and my sister had a while back that ended with her kicking me out of the house we inherited from our mom. We have since resolved our issues, but it still bothers me I guess


So back to this past weekend...first of all I'm very confused by a lot of it. The thoughts I was having all seem very frantic. I didn't eat anything Friday or Saturday. Sunday I tried eating but puked most of it up. Today I finally kept down an apple and a couple bites of a burrito bowl(I thought my favorite food would arouse my appetite). I've lost 19 pounds in two or three days(kinda hard to tell cause I've been on a diet and working out so I was already losing weight). I began burning myself with cigarettes. It wasn't about the pain, more about the absence of pain afterwards. But what scared me most was I almost killed myself. If the trigger pull on the gun I used was just a little shorter I wouldn't be here right now. This however is what made me snap out of it. After realizing what I almost did I calmed down a lot and started trying to figure out what was wrong with me. But before I fully calmed down and while I was still scared I made the mistake of talking to my girlfriend about how I almost pulled the trigger. I needed someone to talk to and for 5 years she was my go to person.

After looking online I think I might have abandonment issues. What sense I can make from my feelings seem to line up with it. I thought about going to my university's counselor, but I don't want to just be prescribed antidepressants that will turn me into a zombie just so some lady can get through her day faster. I'm also terrified my girlfriend(we are talking and have somewhat patched things up) will see the marks from the cigarettes. The girl I dated in high school would cut herself and I know what its like to be on the other side. I don't want to be that person, and I'm ashamed of telling her what I have already. I don't want her to be with me because she feels she can't leave.

To cut straight to the topic, I've been diagnosed with depression, GAD and slight ADD by my current psychiatrist.  I went to one about a year ago who insisted I have bipolar disorder, but I lack the manic episodes (aside from anxiety attacks).  My question is about why it ended up the way it did.

OK so when I was young I grew up in a normal middle class family.  Never been abused, never had serious trauma, grew up with both parents in my family and was homeschooled up until 4th grade.  I began to feel out of place and hopeless when I turned about 14, and I began getting into the emo culture (cliche I know, but please bear with me).  I found out about self harm from a magazine article, and I began to do it.  It never escalated to me needing stitches or getting hospitalized, so my parents kept saying it was just hormones.  
When I turned 18 or 19, I began getting super depressed, paranoid and such.  I'd begun to experience a few hallucinations, mainly auditorial, and that's when my parents finally agreed to take me to a psychiatrist (I received therapy, but it never fixed anything).  My psychiatrist said I had severe depression with psychosis and anxiety.  She started me on Prozac and Seroquel.  I am now on those and Wellbutrin and I'm better than I was (minus anxiety being more prevalent).
SO my question is, why the hell did my depression give me hallucinations?  My psychiatrist said my brain was just going mad but that's not enough info for me to accept it.  

Hallucinations: my first that I remember was seeing a blue figure in my mirror out of the corner of my eye.  I may have just been tired too so I'm not sure if that counts.  My second time I was lying in bed half awake when I distinctly heard a man yelling at me ""What is WRONG with you?!!"".  Now I'm a very spiritual person and I do believe that there are forces that can influence us, but I shook it off and just laughed (not sure why I laughed at that).  The third and last time I was leaving my psychology class, ironically, and I heard someone whisper ""Jazz"" behind me near my ear.  I wasn't sure if someone was trying to get my attention so I turned around, and no one was near me.  It was like in my head and in my ear.

Does anyone have any idea why my mind began doing that? I know schizophrenics and bipolar people can experience that, but psychotic depression continues to baffle me.

Any ideas? ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,It just doesn't make sense to me

I really want to recommend things to people that i watch or do without holding back because i keep thinking this for me, those people shouldn't get to watch it, because it's good and i enjoyed it, and i get jealous of them wanting to see it or talking about.

you.

Winston Churchill famously described his depression as a ""black dog""
that followed him around through life. If you have or have had a
mental illness then I'm interested in any other metaphors or
descriptive, visual feelings you may have about it. These don't have
to necessarily be so particular or well formed as the black dog, I've
previously seen patients in the course of my work who would describe
their episodes of depression as a dense fog descending over their life
or people who saw themselves in schizophrenic episodes as though they were characters on television with viewers commentating on their
actions. I'm not looking for anything made up purely for this post,
and reality is more important than exaggerated imagery here.

The aim of getting these views is to produce some art based upon them, partly because I think this will be interesting work and partly to
enable a better understanding of how people with mental illness feel.
The medium will be dependent on the content but I have mainly worked in oils, ink and copper plate etching in the past. 

For those descriptions that I end up using the final work would be displayed alongside the original description, which would be anonymised. If you would like to see any pieces that result from your contribution that can be arranged and I'll keep you updated if they ever go on display. If the piece is two dimensional and of a reasonable size for a scanner I would be happy to send you a copy.

Here then are the questions I'd like you to answer and message to me.
You can answer in the comments if you feel comfortable but a private
message might allow a bit more openness.

1). What (if any) mental illness have you been diagnosed with?
2). In visual or metaphoric terms how does this illness make you feel?
How do you feel about this illness?
3). Has this visualisation helped you deal with your illness at all,
or has it hindered you? And how?

Any other information you feel might be pertinent would also be
gratefully received, but I'm not looking for the full history of your
illness or any personal information. Include an email address if you
would like to be kept updated as I mentioned above. I will also not be
giving out any medical advice, as this is not an appropriate forum. If
the issues raised by this are troubling you I suggest you visit your
general practitioner, or your psychiatrist if you have one.

My mother was diagnosed as schizophrenic when I was a baby.  The first time she had an episode was 1 week after my birth and my father had no idea what was happening.  She was eventually hospitalized and given the diagnosis of schizophrenia. I am now 33 and I also have a 34 year old brother.  My father and her are still married and live together. 
The majority of the time my mother is on her medication and ""fine"" beyond some of the side effects from the meds.  No one outside our family would realize anything is wrong and honestly I was brought up not speaking about the problem when she is ""fine"" the family doesn't even talk about the schizophrenia. 

She seems to relapse every 3-5 years which results in eventual hospitalization.  Her last relapse was about 4 years ago and actually lasted for an entire year until it reached a point that her weight was dangerously low and her behavior increasingly concerning.  After a 10 hour ordeal of me calling 911, followed by something called the SCIP unit they were able to convince her to go with them (she was basically told she had to go with them or they were going to take her against her will).  Within 24 hours of being admitted and on whatever medication they had her on she began to come out of it, feel extreme regret at stopping her medication and was very apologetic.  She got ""better"" so quick and we finally had our mom.  She was so happy to be back home and to herself.   

I am not 100% sure which schizophrenia she is diagnosed with but  when she relapses and and enters what I guess would be called psychosis these are her symptoms:

* Stops sleeping/insomnia
* Eating habits change (last time she lost over 50lbs and obsessed over her weight.  She will also binge drink soda and chain smoke.  
* She becomes incredibly angry at my father and grandmother.  My parents are still married and currently my father and her live alone together.  She will get in my fathers face and state things that are not true ..as my father walks away she will throw herself in front of him and then if he as much as places a hand on her to attempt to get by her she will scream and fall to the ground claiming he is beating her.  I have witnessed this many times and my father is not being aggressive or beating her. 
* She withdraws from everyone and everything. 
* She will talk to herself, pace around the kitchen and go from crying to laughing.  She will yell about JFK and Jackie Kennedy and seems to think she is part of their family.  She will turn on music and just dance ridiculously around the kitchen. 
* She has no awareness at all when she is in psychosis that something is wrong.  She will claim she doesn't feel well and has a fever or the flu.
* I believe she takes her meds regularly and at some point for whatever reason her meds must need tweaking bc things start to go off balance.  Once that happens it's a downward spiral to her completely not taking her meds anymore.  However it is not a case of her one day pre-psychosis deciding she doesn't feel like taking them and just stopping.

So my problem is because of all the laws we have an incredibly difficult time getting her early intervention or help.  Last weekend is when she began to relapse so I immediately called the SCIP unit who sent someone out to evaluate her, she of course said everything was fine (she just ""has a fever"") and declined any type of help.  They unfortunately said they could tell something was ""off"" but since she did not present as a danger to herself or others they could not make her go.  Basically we now have to wait until she reaches rock bottom before we can get help.  

Does anyone know any other way around this?? What can we do?  I fear for my fathers safety even though she has never threatened herself or others I do have that fear one day with her anger towards him she will act out.  

When she is medicated she is aware of the illness and 100% clear that she does not want to be off her meds and always regrets going off them when she relapses.  

We don't know what to do.  I'm happy to answer any questions people might have.  We all love my mother very much and I can't imagine losing her to this for another 6 months or even a year because we have to wait for it to get bad enough for help.  

I apologize if the terminology or anything I say is not correct.  Much of what I know about this disease is simply through my own research online. 

She is in NJ- if that matters.

It was only the second appointment, and she mainly just tampered with my medications a little.  Specifically, she changed my anxiety medication from Klonopin to Xanax because: (1) I didn't think the Klonopin was actually helping, and may have been giving more anxiety on top of it because it's addictive and I've heard plenty of horror stories about it; and (2) even on a low dosage, the Klonopin knocked me the eff *out*, which meant I couldn't take it during the day, when I was most likely to actually be stressed and anxious.

But she also said something else, that I'm *still* mad about.

The short version of it is, I had a panic attack--an honest to God, full on panic attack, with tears and screaming and hair pulling and punching myself in the face in public, something which hasn't happened since *middle school*--over something minor and stupid.  This (the minor and stupid thing, not the panic attack) is I've done before, a lot of times, and that is *very* easy to do because even someone like *me* can do it.  But for whatever reason, it wasn't working that day, and it took me multiple tries to do it, and I had other, more important things to do, but this was my only chance to get it done that day and it *had* to get done that day.  Think something like paying a bill by phone, or refilling a prescription, or even getting a gas pump to take your credit card.  That's what I'm talking about when I say *basic, stupid stuff that anyone can do*, and it *just wasn't happening*, and I flipped out and lost it in a very uncool way.

As you can probably guess, I have an anxiety disorder.  Add in some depression, a family history that includes suicide and schizophrenia on *both* sides, and a very awkward and isolated childhood (only child, parents had me in their 40s, none of their friends had any children, etc.) and you've got a picture of someone who has *issues*.  But anyway, my psychiatrist *knows* I have issues with my anxiety.  She *knows* both of my parents had massive anger issues.  She *knows* I'm on medication for an anxiety disorder and *knows* I really don't like it when my schedule gets disrupted and routine things take a lot of time and effort.  And there I am in her office, telling her about my panic attack over something *I acknowledged was stupid*, and what is her response?

To sit there, removed from the situation by *several* days, a brain that is *not* burdened with mental illness, free from the several *external* stressors I have to deal with *every fucking day of my miserable life*, and *lecture me* on how what I did was not reasonable.  To say I threw a ""tantrum"" over something that ""was never any issue at all.""  

**I FUCKING KNOW THAT ALREADY**.  What I wanted, what I *dearly* wanted, to say right then, was, ""If I could handle stressors and annoyances like this, *I would not need a fucking psychiatrist in the first place!*  You cannot diagnose someone with an anxiety disorder, prescribe them medication for it, and then **CHEW THEM OUT** when they react like you'd expect someone with an anxiety disorder to react!  Especially not when they're in the office telling you their medication isn't working and using this episode as an example of *how* it isn't working, and *doubly* so when **THEY ALREADY KNOW** that they reacted inappropriately.  What the flying **FUCK** is wrong with you?""

What I actually said was, ""I know what I did was stupid.  I also don't think the Klonopin is working.  That's why I'm here.""  That got me another brief lecture, followed by her trying to talk me into a *higher* dosage of Klonopin, but I held my ground and said I wanted something different.  Thus, the Xanax (at a *smaller* dosage than the Klonopin; I truly do not understand this practice).  I do wonder why she is so persistent in pushing benzos on me, but for now the Xanax at least doesn't knock me out.

But I'm still upset with her about what she said, when she said it.  I still don't think her lecturing was appropriate at all, and I want her to know this because I have had a lot of bad experiences with psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals over the years and I do not want to take this lying down any longer.  *But*-but, my next appointment isn't until May 12.  And bringing it up then, it will be so distant and remote that I don't think it will be effective at all.  

So here we come to my question: Is it appropriate now, three days after the offending event, to email my psychiatrist and tell her how and why I feel offended by what she said to me on Monday?  What sort of response should I expect from her?  I am fearful of escalating things in a way that could lead her to spitefully attempt to have me involuntarily committed (which is a *huge* fear of mine, and has been ever since an abusive ex tried to have me committed for self-harming *in response to their abuse*, and is not going to go away based on anything written by a stranger on Reddit), and I'm also afraid of being subjected to further abuse by her.  

I know I can fire her.  I know that.  I fucking *know* it, okay?  I've done it to other mental health professionals in the past who have been unhelpful and even harmful.  But I think the medications this one has prescribed, Klonopin aside, *have* been helpful, and I don't see this person for therapy in any event, only psychiatric medication.  I don't want to throw away a functional medication regimen over one insult; I just want her to be on notice that I was offended by what she said, know that I do not appreciate what she said, and would like to continue our doctor/patient relationship because she is otherwise a (seemingly) competent doctor, which in my experience is a *rare* thing to find.

So.  I've talked a lot.  I will shut up now, except to repeat my question below; any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** My doctor said something stupid and hurtful on Monday, and I am *still* angry about it, but won't see her again until May 12.  Do I email her *now*, three days after the fact, to let her know that I'm offended by what she said, or do I continue to bite my tongue because I was an idiot and did not say it right then?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,An Etiquette Question: When is it Appropriate to Tell Your Psychiatrist You Thought They Were Rude?

Amazing. My family has very good finances and I have never ever had to worry about money, and I have never not got something I wanted. I have absolutely amazing parents who love me, support me in absolutely everything I do and show time after time they would do anything for me. I have the most amazing girlfriend I could ever ask for, she is straight out of a dream. She has also shown me time after time she would do anything for me. I have the most amazing friends in the world who support me through everything and would do anything for me. I have the most amazing life in the world. I have ZERO reason to be depressed. ZERO reason to be anxious. ZERO reason to be angry about anything.

Also, I'm not really a ""kid"". I'm a university student. But I sure as hell have the mentality of a child. 

YET despite this amazing life that I know I have and am extremely grateful for, I am always absolutely drowned in anxiety and depression. It debilitates my life completely. I can't hold down a job because I get so anxious that I can't do the most basic of functions. My depression makes me sit around doing absolutely nothing. I will not be motivated to do my school work or anything that the modern day world would consider productive or useful. I smoke marijuana quite heavily to escape from it, and have used other substances as well, although nowhere near the usage amount that I do with marijuana.

I have a psychiatrist. Officially, I am diagnosed with GAD and Bi-Polar II disorder. I also have never ever been able to sleep in my life. I have tried tons of different medications. Prozac, which I don't even remember how well it worked, but all I remember is feeling like a zombie who could not experience any emotion whatsoever. Pristiq, the same thing. Seroquel XR which turned me absolutely psychotic. Klonopin which was clearly screwing up my cognitive abilities beyond belief. 

I would never commit suicide, but only because I'm extremely afraid of death and going to hell or a hell-like place. I am probably depressed enough at times to do it if I wasn't so afraid. My anxiety is so bad that my hands are drenched in sweat all the time. 

I am so, so, so unhappy and depressed and anxious. I'm extremely afraid for my future because if I am having this much trouble having the most amazing life ever, I am ABSOLUTELY screwed when I am dealing with full adult responsibilities, with my horrible job that I hate with horrible pay that I got with my horrible degree because I couldn't focus on school. 

I am just an absolute cluster!@#$ of a person. I am COMPLETELY stuck in my head at all times to the point where the outside world is completely tuned out at times. I think this may be because when I first went to the doctor about my sleep (FINALLY), I was told to take dramamine/dimenhydrinate because it makes you drowsy. Taking one worked for a while, and then 1 became 2, 2 became 4, 4 became 8, etc. 

For some extra background info, my mother has struggled with mental health herself, even having to go to a psychiatric unit for a while because it got so bad at one point. My uncle committed suicide because of depression. My grandfather was so depressed he wouldn't even get out of bed. My girlfriend was raped in the summer. 

I will be absolutely depressed for several weeks, then I will ALWAYS have this approx. 2-3 weeks where I completely change, am the happiest person in the world, have all my priorities straight, completely quit the drugs etc. I always think that this is the time it's all over. Then the crash comes. It always comes.

The worst part is, part of me wonders if I actually have all these problems. Sometimes I think I am an absolutely amazing, cunning, manipulative psychopath who has convinced himself of all of this so he has some sort of excuse for things. I really hope that's not the case.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so depressed. I am so anxious. Especially right now that I'm growing up I have never been so lost in my life. I have no idea what direction to go in or what to do at absolutely any time. I am so afraid.

I've drawn a few conclusions in that regard and found a few belief systems that coincide with my views, but there has been an unintended consequence.

I think the world revolves around me. It is my belief that everything that I am experiencing is carefully orchestrated to make me a better person, and to make me into my ideal self. It goes deeper into that. If I have a problem, there is almost always a solution to it. And not nessecarily an easy one, but there almost always seems to be some sort of solution to my problems. Sometimes I reach it myself, and sometimes I have help from other people. But the solutions almost always result in an ending that is not nearly as disastrous as I thought it was going to be.

This is becoming dangerous for me, because it is making me someone that is complacent and afraid of action. I guess that I perceive an external locus of control. 

I don't know. It really is frustrating. I know that it doesn't really make sense, but when I *really* think about it, it does to me. The more I think about it, the more I believe it. The more I believe it, the harder it becomes to be motivated for anything, really. Especially caring about doing something about it.

I've told friends about it, and their main reaction is that ""You don't seem crazy, so you must not be. You seem fine.""

Felt like my blood was having trouble circulating or something, it sounds weird I know. But that's how i describe it. So I asked my mom to take me to a running track because I thought the exercise would help the blood flow. After jogging about half a mile I noticed my muscles on one side of my body starting to clench up. It progressively got worse for the next half mile of walking back to my mom. It was almost impossible to walk back, but I managed it looking like I was retarded. It seemed like a stroke, and that's what I thought had occurred years after. But at that point my mom drove me to an emergency room, they took an MRI and found a pineal cyst that may be symptomatic (2 cm). They gave me muscle relaxers which did absolutely nothing, my head was painfully turned to one side and my arms and legs on the same side were pulled-in painfully as well. This seemed so serious to me, it seemed like a stroke. But after about 5 hours (even w/ the muscle relaxers) the stroke-like incident went away.

I've noticed some cognitive impairment after this incident that is so hard to describe. The left side of my face feels a little numb too.

A few years later I felt strange again at a quiet restaurant. I was in line for my food and my ears pop and it's like my hearing went away, I started to see a dark spot in the center of my vision, I had to sit down. I could have passed out easily there had I not fought this.

Scared if I don't try to straighten her out she will hate me later, but also that she couldn't cope with the truth. Need advice.

My sister fits all of the BPD symptoms. She feels things very deeply, is always emotional, makes and breaks friend/relationships almost ferociously, is impulsive, extremely focused on self image, and engages in a lot of risky behaviour. She has covered herself in tattoos and piercings and is either/both unwilling or unable to get a job, so she manipulates our parents for money. She is incredibly dogmatic and politically correct, never says please or thank you, never asks after anyone else, and seems to live an entirely self-focused existence. There's a lot of dissociation and she gets extremely upset thinking about the future.

It's gotten to the point where I just dont' want to be around her and that makes me so sad. Despite all this I love her and can see that behind all this absolutely appalling behaviour there is a really lovely woman with a lot going for her -- she is bright and smart, creative, has skills that would be useful in a workplace -- it's just really hard to kind of sift through how much of the way she is is due to mental illness that she can't help, and how much is just personality/bad decisions/general nastiness.

The whole family has been walking on eggshells around her for years and I don't think she has ever had anyone really hold up a mirror to her and confronted her with the truth about how she treats people and the appalling decisions she's making. My mother has very little money and health issues of her own, and is in a constant state of anxiety.

I worry that in ten years my sister is going to turn around and be angry that we didn't stage some sort of intervention to stop her from throwing her youth away. My parents are basically propping her up financially but I an concerned that this is just enabling her to keep living the way she is and not confronting reality. But is there any way to get through to someone with BPD or a related disorder? Can interventions work? She lies all the time about going to see counsellors and psychologists. And my biggest fear is that she will just cut us off completely and disappear and hurt herself irretrievably.

Sorry for the wall of text. I hope that what I've written isn't triggering for anyone and that I haven't said anything that reflects badly on others. I just wish someone could tell me what to do!

We both grew up with depression and anxiety issues and are now in our late 20's.

In college I sought help and found a great therapist that helped me get my issues under control and since then my life has improved exponentially.  My sister on the other hand is extremely reluctant to find help and hasn't been able to hold down a job, still lives at home, has few friends and gets into huge dust ups with our mom on a near monthly basis.  It's caused a rift to form between them and it breaks my heart to see my family hurt like this.

My question is, how can I better reccomend therapy to my sister?  She doesn't have health insurance and can't afford the premiums in our state for Obamacare.  Additionally, she carries the view that therapy is for ""crazy"" people and that's not her.  To complicate things further, she was committed for a week when she was 20 after she had a nervous breakdown and the whole experience soured her view of mental health practicioners.

Anyhow, today is her birthday and she's had another big fight involving both my parents over finding a job.  All celebration plans have been cancelled and everyone is pissed off.

I tend to also move my body to respond to these thoughts too and showing facial features to respond to them. It's really hard to concentrate on anything in my life these days when my mind is practically in the clouds.
My younger brother has Autism, I'm starting to think that I might have a similar problem to him in a way. When he was still lived with us, he never talked very much but always moved his hands following his mind and ideas. I'm afraid that I might actually have some form of that, when I was younger I use to do something similar and also move my body accordingly as if I was hallucinating. I have to admit, I'm honestly really scared at this point, strangers look at me different all the time and it's really hard to control these constant thoughts. I tried speaking to doctor about it but I never went back for a blood test.
To put emphasis on how severe it can be, I can usually remember something very specific such as a small word on a list of ingredients and will think of that, dialogue with people can be remember precisely for months on and I will keep thinking about them constantly all at once. I constantly have headaches most of the time in my front side of the brain(probably caused by lack of sleep) and it's really killing me.

I'm just kind of going to write this in the way that it all comes to me because I don't really know what is going on.

* I go through these phases at least twice a day where I just want to stand up and throw things, destroy them, run around, etc. 
* These are usually accompanied by me not being able to sit still and I actually am kind of going through one of these right now. I just want to scream and throw a fit of sorts.
* Around 2-3 times a week before I go to bed I will hear people repeating what I think in my head out loud. It sometimes is repeated until they're basically screaming at me about buying the eggs or something of the sort.
* My thoughts sometimes become uncontrollable, my mind will race and certain phrases will become stuck on repeat. It won't stop until the other thoughts on the left side of my head tell it to stop, but then the word stop just gets stuck on repeat and they almost argue of sorts.

* I will be watching my teacher in class (for example) and suddenly everything around me will become hyper realistic, like I was out of a fog, but then as soon as it starts I'm back to the regular fog.

I was put on amitriptyline for a few months for Cluster Headaches, and during that time was when the voices kind of started. I've been taken off of it but they're just continuing and getting worse. I wasn't even on a high dose of meds.

* I will be out with friends and I'll go and spend my money recklessly. One person I used to know would take advantage of this and I would lend her 100+ dollars to buy stuff and never get paid back. I will be extremely loud and confident and will even just go up to random strangers and strike up conversations (I live in a country where this is considered absolutely crazy so it doesn't come off well). I will recklessly take pills, not caring if I down half of the bottle. 

* In the following hours I'll completely crash and go into a state of self hate and I will basically stare blankly into space and feel numb and all I can think of is how much I hate myself and how everyone around me probably hates me. I have self harmed before and have contemplated suicide. 

I have gone to a doctor before (when I was being taken off of the amitriptyline) and my parents refused to let me tell the doctor everything. They spoke for me and left most of my problems out. THe doctor said I sounded bipolar and my father argued with the doctor, yelling at him that he wasn't smart and was just trying to put me on more meds and that I was fine. The doctor took me off of the medication and now they keep telling me how much better I am but in reality I am not any better, sometimes even worse. 

I told my mother that I was still hearing the voices and she responded with ""Well you're off of the medication now so that's not true"". She refuses to believe that I need any form of help.

I don't want to come across as one of those girls on tumblr who thinks that mental illness is a fad and makes you deep and interesting and it's 'cool'. I know that I sound like a whiny teenager complaining about my problems. I just really, really am sick of everything that is happening to me and I don't know what's going on and I'm scared and I hate this. 

I don't really know what to do, I just want someone to tell me what to do. What do you think is happening to me? Should I tell my parents what is happening? 

I'm sorry for how long it is and how it's a rant.

 I will tell you my story so it may help you. First of all, I had a really rough childhood. Typical  strict father an appreciative mother  and a brother who is better in everything. I've never been valued so I always wanted to prove I worth living in my whole life. Giving me non stopping stress all the time. Fearing that others will judge me or won't appraise me. My father uses to beat me and my mom. And when my mother tried to divorce things went even worse. I don't really want to mention that part in detail right now.
Maybe later if you will be interested.

 I had suicidal thoughts and from a sudden I was the happiest person on Earth, and after a few months I fell in depression again. This never ending cycle killed all my relationships. Nobody could stay near me and I totally understand it. My unpredictable behavior made my girlfriend leave me. And I also left school. I was totally worthless and down. Extreme mood wobbling  made me forget who I really am. I can't really answers questions honestly if they ask for my opinion. I don't really know who I am and what is the true me. I always wanted to prove to others and the fear of failing buried my personality.

 Finally I decided to make the first step and help myself. I was afraid of my suicidal thoughts. I wanted to create a place which will heal my soul if needed and can calm me down if Im in the maniac phase. And to give it purpose I should help others with the same problems. Music was my savior. Music can save your life! It saved mine. I found genres that can really help you and I wanted it to reach others, and to create a home for  it where others and me can always reach it. So I created a YouTube channel where I upload music that helps you get through in life. keep listening to music cause it gets you through everything I promise. I've been making this channel since half-year. And my mood is stabilizing. No more suicidal thoughts no more extreme maniac phases. The name of my YouTube channel is Bipolar Penguin Music and you can reach it here if you want : https://www.youtube.com/user/bipolarpenguinmusic . 

 I really hope it will help at least one person here. All the Best for you guys!

So one day I read an article about someone arrested for child porn. Street along with other details describe my friend perfectly. 
After calling several times I show up to his house. He answers the door and seems a bit off, but im thinking ""He's here. So maybe it wasn't him"". 

I mention someone on his street being arrested the day before, he plays dumb. It worries me for weeks until the court date posted in the article arrives. We hang out, so I think it must be a crazy coincidence. His laptop is gone which freaks me the fuck out- he tells me it broke.

Months pass (I'm not around, I live several hours away- I talk to him often playing games and also visit him when I visit my family) He starts to smoke weed which he was 100% against his entire life. I'm thinking, it either is a MASSIVE coincidence or his offense was minor- got his laptop taken, slap on the wrist.  One night he texts me saying his girlfriend of around 8 years broke up with him. He's extremely depressed, goes on about how hes an awful person, hes lied to his girlfriend and been an ass to her (no specifics). I reassure him hes a good person etc etc.

Months pass. I visit for an extended period during christmas, we hang out a lot- he tells me he wants to travel the world and for weeks tries to convince me to drop my life and go with him. He's VERY convincing, makes sure im high before he brings it up each time- I'm actually kinda considering it but I still think about the whole child porn thing and it worries me a bit but at the same time it's been months.

Months pass. He tells me hes seeing someone for depression, is on antidepressents. I start to worry about him a lot and try to talk to him as often as possible. He slowly seems more and more distant, it's harder to keep conversations going and hes constantly making plans to talk online and then bailing. 

His girlfriend messages me. He's been arrested for child porn, and it's the WORST kind (torture, animals everything). I make plans to meet with her and talk about it and i spend a few days collecting my thoughts.


During discussion she mentions how he's cheated on her so many times. I'm extremely taken aback. Apparently he's cheated on her countless times during the length of their ENTIRE relationship. Goes on about his porn addiction (which I kinda already knew) but tells me about all these other sketchy things - trying to get her to do threesomes, asking to put their private pics on the internet like its no big deal all the while he constantly puts her down calling her a slut for wearing knee length skirts or going out drinking or smoking weed which at the time he was 100% against.. lately he drinks and smokes more then most people I know. I'm furious.

I knew for a while he could be a massive asshole to her, but I would always just get his perspective and either kinda take his side or just not get into it.
They've broken up countless times, (I already knew but didn't know how many) because of his cheating.   Each time hes depressed, makes her feel guilty and tries to get her back until he finds someone else then he completely ignores her until the new girl leaves him and he comes crawling back and she would always take him back because he'd be so sweet and sincere. I'm not even getting into all of it (him constantly texting other girls- that SHE KNOWS and would tell her about it, her friends joking about making porn then texting him to see how far hell go with planning it. He would always find a way to make her feel guilty or if all else fails be extremely apologetic.

Now, your thinking how can he be so convincing? Well he is. I've always known hes incredible at convincing people and I've told him it countless times. He's gotten me to skip class in highschool to the point of almost failing, skip work, buy shit like games claiming he'd buy it too then not buying it etc etc. It's only been the last year or two that I decided to be more aware of it and say no. Unfortunately she hasn't been as strong. He cheated after the arrest and when she finally broke up with him for good he pulled out an old engagement ring that he tried to propose to her with years ago saying he was going to ask her again.

She shows me his texts after the break up. He's not nearly as aggressive with trying to get back together but he still hints at it. She reads me pages and pages of their texts..... and everything he says ... is PERFECT. He doesn't slip up, he always knows JUST what to say to make her feel the most guilt yet still comes across completely innocent. I tell her this and she seems a bit reluctant but agrees.


I tell her - ""If he TRUELY feels guilty and hates himself for what hes putting you through.. would he not realize that the constant endless stream of texts is putting you through incredible guilt? He's a smart guy so I'm almost certain he knows it would be the RIGHT thing to do... but that will leave him alone and from the sounds of it he'd much rather drag you through the dirt time and time again then spend a moment alone.""

Before meeting with her I told her I hoped me and him could become friends again but I know it would NEVER be anything like it was.

After talking I tell her that I'm almost certain I won't speak to him for a few months and when I do I will simply tell him ""I'm only here because I know you need someone to make it through this and I'm willing to be that person.""

Thoughts?
_________________________
EDIT 1:

I understand everyone staying stay away. But at the same time, this person was an extremely close friend of mine for almost 10 years so it's FAR easier to say that when it's not your friend. The whole thing is just completely fucked and at times I feel like it could destroy me as I personally don't have many other people in my life due to social anxieties.

Also, if we both just walk away then theres a good chance he'll kill himself and it's a guilt that neither of us can just ignore as much as a part of us would like to. It's already quite likely that he'll get attacked in there and I know a few people that could possibly kill him when he's out. I value human life and theres people that have done FAR worse, not to say what he did isn't wrong. But we both understand that it is in a way a sickness and I also forgot to mention he came from a fairly abusive family and suspect he could have been abused physically and/or sexually as a young child. 

After some time to think about it I think i'll tell him to leave his ex alone and I'll tell her i'll handle it and i'll just keep her informed of how he's doing from time to time. As much as I'd like to run, a part of me doesn't feel right about it. The thought that there might be hope for him to get better and one day lead the best life he can given his situation. 
It is the last straw though. One more fuckup- one more big lie and he'll be left alone and I'll make sure he knows it.


If anyones gone through something similar i'd love to hear their experience or any professionals that have stories or advice. Anything.
_____________
EDIT 2:

I'm still getting a lot of people saying the same thing but I wanna stress I'M NOT ONLY STICKING AROUND FOR HIM! His girlfriend is having a lot more trouble with feeling guilt and even though I tell her it's not our fault if he doesn something- she has to be able to think that way on her own and not just from others telling it to her.

Also if I leave, then she will DEFINITELY stick around. There is no way I could do that to her and I'd much rather it be me then her.

Finally, if we cast aside every person that has these kinds of fucked up problems then how can we ever expect to stop it? This type of shit is gonna happen to a lot of people and I'd like to think it can be prevented in the cases of growing up with an abusive family. I'm not in anyway saying that what he did wasn't absolutely disgusting and that he deserves forgiveness from anyone... but I for one would like to know if it can be helped and if the friend I once new actually exists in some form or if it was all just a lie.

Thanks to everyone whose taken the time to read this!

Diagnosed last year as moderate though it's very intense at some points. It's led me to the typical symptoms (Self-harm, anxiety, general lethargic behavior.) and I am on medication for it. I'm wondering if anything else has developed over the course of the year because I feel very.. different.

To put it in perspective, I feel sort of socially inept. I'm not that reclusive but I am very aware of some behaviors that I don't think are typical or that I've experienced as much before. I'll list them:
- When talking, I have the tendency to get words mixed up or slur them. This happens usually when I'm trying to explain something.
- Sometimes when I think about it, my footing kind of shifts while walking and it makes me walk some paces kind of awkwardly. I don't know if this is noticeable or I'm just over thinking it.
- I don't feel very personable with anyone. I feel like I come off as weird. If I notice myself being too quiet, it's extremely hard to get myself to say anything without croaking a bit at first.
- There's a lot of moments in the day where I get very groggy. No matter how much sleep I get or how much coffee I drink.

A friend of mine is starting a project called Mind Memoirs. The idea behind it is that mental health is often an uncomfortable subject that many people don't understand, and it is important to raise awareness of the ways people all around us have been affected by a mental illness. We would like to help people understand a variety of mental illnesses, from depression to anxiety, ADHD to PTSD, depersonalization to phobias, addiction to bipolar, and everything in between.

The intention is to gather anonymous stories from all over and then perform them as monologues, spoken word poetry, and short sketches, in order for viewers to connect with sufferers of mental illness on an emotional level. We'd like viewers to see that anyone can be a sufferer, and that mental illness does not need to be taboo.

Mind Memoirs is starting as a university level project in the US, but we are looking to showcase all kinds of stories about all kinds of mental health experiences from all over the world. We hope that the project will eventually expand, but for now we are collecting stories for an initial performance later this quarter.

We are collecting stories until May 10th, and they can be submitted either in a comment on this thread, a PM to my account, or as an email (mindmemoirs@yahoo.com). Stories will always be handled respectfully and anonymously. 

If you would like to participate, or simply to spread the word, we would be extremely grateful.

So I wrote out this huge long thing but I wasn't really getting anywhere so here are just the basic points that are bothering me:  
 - Feel fucked-up and broken since I was kid (surprised I'm not in jail or pregnant or something, I mean I was a REALLY fucked up kid)  
 - Just want to be normal but I feel it's impossible (esp. considering where I came from / what I am)  
 - I want bonfires and silliness and support and so on but literally everybody I've ever met and liked has a) liked me at first and then b) stopped liking me as much. AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.  
 - I want to date and be intimate but I'm too ugly/unattractive for this to be possible  
 - Trying to accept I will just never be as good as my little sister  
 - Trying to accept people will always just like her better, including family, and for good reason  
 - Trying to be strong and just stop hanging out with people I don't like, namely my 'best friend' of five years who I recently realized is not a good friend or person and if I'd met him for the first time today I'd just find him really annoying and pitiful, and I don't think he's ever going to change  
 - Even though I have nobody else to talk to 
 - Trying to figure out whether it's a good idea to reconnect with people I knew and liked in high school, now that they're back for the summer...trying to like navigate social waters  
 - Failed two classes this semester for no good reason  
 - Feel taken hostage by myself re procrastination...just can't seem to get over it even though I know all I have to do is just...do it. Considering tattoo of Nike symbol on forehead  
 - Trying to avoid drinking, drugs, and cutting. This is going fairly well at least  
 - But when it wasn't I was drinking solo in my apartment one night and went for a walk and got arrested for public intox on a Wednesday night and now I have this fine to pay by the 2nd of May and I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IT and I'm just hoping my tax rebate comes in in time because I don't get my first paycheque of the summer until like the 16th May and I don't want to borrow any more money from my mother because a) already borrowed 200 b) she doesn't really HAVE all that much c) i'd have to lie  
 - Afraid I'm going to fuck up AGAIN because I can never tell at the beginning about bad ideas and then they explode and I'm like ""am i fucking retarded, why didn't i realize i shouldn't have done that""  
 - Afraid there's something incurably wrong with me and I'll never be happy  
 - Trying to get over parents divorcing and losing everything due to mutual bitching, even though honestly I'm not that affected by the divorce itself it's just that everything has changed and I'll never see my house again and we used to be fairly well off but now everybody is poor  
 - Trying to get over hating/pitying my parents for who they are / being afraid I'm going to turn out like them / can totally see their traits in me / feeling bad about hating my own flesh and blood  
 - Afraid that I'm just supposed to kill myself and get it over with even though the world is really pretty and nice overall  
 - Afraid one day I'll decide the world doesn't make up for me being me in it  
 - Afraid I'm putting too much stock into this 'help' / afraid I'm unhelpable / afraid even if I am helpable it'll take too much time and my life will be wasted by the time I get around to enjoying it  
 - Afraid that the only help that will actually help me will be too expensive  
 - Afraid afraid afraid, and sad. I don't really feel afraid but it's the only word for it

Here's the text I posted: 

I feel like shit. Every single day. We live in a society where we can only be accepted trough perfection and I let that affect me. For the past 2 years I've been a perfectionist doing everything to the extreme, killing myself to get a good self image, but I just can't. When I see myself in the mirror I see a disgusting and horrible human being. I guarantee you if you talk to anyone I know they will say I'm the person they want to be. Good grades, good family, friends, and other stuff.
They just don't know how much it costs everyday to wake up, and put on that costume. I cry and die inside, everyday, every night, I live in a world of lies built inside of me.

The best description I can make, is my real inside, deep in there, blocked by walls and thorns, dying and rottening inside a little, everyday it passes.

The worst part of all is that people make little jokes to mess around 
and I just laugh and don't care, but they seriously don't realize how much they are killing me inside cause of that. I'm sick and tired of wearing this costume of a living, but I've been raised with a perfectionist mentallaty, so if anything goes wrong, I was raised and drowned with subliminal messages to fix it, at all costs, even if it takes too much.

I'm just so mad and angry, that I can't have a normal mentallaty, you don't know how hard I try to pretend when something's wrong I'm not the one to need to fix it. I cry and worry desperatly to certain points just to see it fixed and all normal and good.

I did some research online and, while I found many sites praising the benefits of talking about one's mental health issues or day-to-day troubles, I couldn't find resources explaining exactly WHY talking helps. I did find one site geared towards councilors that had some information.  If anyone here would add to or comment on this list, I would interested to know more about it:

 How does talking help?
1. The main benefit is the opportunity to speak freely about whatever troubles you, to be accepted and listened to properly. Few people really listen to us without wanting something in return.What you will be offered is a safe place where someone will attempt to understand what you are going through.

2. Putting private thoughts and hidden feelings into words can be a huge relief.Openness and safety is very important in counselling and can bring some balance back into your life and create a sense of control.

3. When we want to understand our behaviour, individual psychology can help a great deal. Using the counsellor as a guide, you can become more practised in exploring the way you think and feel, gaining more self-awareness.

4. Sometimes we just need someone alongside us in our troubles. Talking can make us feel less alone when times are hard.

5. Receiving feedback from a skilled listener puts difficulties into perspective, so that you can make realistic plans to tackle them. Not only will this restore your self esteem and confidence but give you a draft for overcoming problems in the future.

This is the challenge of counselling. It involves our facing making changes in the way we do things and having the courage to do so. It may feel risky at first but it is a way of finding our true selves and discovering our deepest resources.

When I was younger, I would have severely disturbing dreams. I don't recall watching any scary movies or reading any books or being subjected to any material at all that could possibly make my dreams into such a gorefest. Most people wake up when something scary or awful happens but I'd stay dreaming and when I finally would wake up, I'd feel sick and ""not all here"" the rest of the day. These happened fairly regularly until I was about 8 and were so vivid I can still recall them (and, at 22, they still make me feel queasy).

Along with this, I would also have horrible derealization/depersonalization episodes at any mentions of violence/abuse/blood. For example, my parents used to read the Harry Potter books out loud to me and my younger sib and I distinctly recall a part where Ron gets in a fight and his nose is bleeding. Hearing that part caused me to internally panic, feel horribly sick and then suddenly things went kind of foggy and I felt like I was watching myself from behind my eyes. The feeling lingered into the next day. Things like this happened pretty regularly until I was 17 or so.

So ... What causes this? My parents are divorced because my father was emotionally and verbally abusive for the entirety of the marriage. There's a chance he may have gone further than that but I don't know because large chunks of my childhood are totally missing. I suppose that's one other thing; I had a ""terrible memory"" throughout most of elementary school. By the time I'd leave at the end of the day, I'd be unable to recall most of what I did the whole day.

All of this feels very not-normal but I have no clue what could cause it or where I'd start in bringing it up to my therapist.

Does anyone else feel like you're ""better"" when you have something to focus on?

Like.. I get into a really good story, or I work some random calc problems from my old text book, or I play an involved video game, just latch on to any one *thing* to focus all my energy on and all of the problems in my head just melt away into the aether for as long as whatever that *thing* has my focus.

I can't tell if I'm imagining it or if I'm just fooling myself, but it's like.. the only time I can find peace from myself is when something has my focus.

I've always been very layer back and nice although quiet at times but recently I become randomly anxious for absolutely no reason or I just feel like this weird subliminal rage and want to lash out and scream and hit anything nearby. Its annoying and a little terrifying, but I know that being wary of it is sorta good so I guess theres that. Ive also become hyper self conscious and just can't seem to connect with people or escape constant feelings of judgement. With all that being said I've had a pretty crazy last year and a half..

I lost my Dad in August unexpectedly so Im sure its intertwined with that, I spent about 4-6 months in total zombie mode with what  felt like mild PTSD (he spent some time in the hospital, bloodied and twitching in the ER, shaved head on life support, yah. Weird scenario to have dropped on you at 19) but Ive somewhat recently pulled out a bit and started enjoying life again. Still trying to help my mom through it. My gf rushed to the hospital and showed amazing support for us but soon after he officially passed she moved into her first year of college and we hit our lowest low as expected. I spent probably a solid month with little to no sleep and very little actual mental activity, just this weird solid immovable block of mental fatigue and incredible frustration and depression worrying about her and my mom/sister and trying to process my Dads passing. But my gf and I made it and we're better than ever now(over 2yrs now). But wait, theres more! About a year prior to my fathers passing I was kicked out of their house shortly after graduating high school. Mostly I just fought an incredible amount with my mother and sometimes my Dad, tho he was always the one I truly bonded with more. Madres kinda crazy but I still said things to her I will forever regret. We fought away too intensely from like ages 15-19. Full on yelling and cursing matches, throwing dishes and books(that was actually all the parents, I just spoke like an insolent little c*nt), getting kicked out even in winter. Once my Dad even drove me around trying to find a police station open that would take me up for adoption (luckily they don't accept 18 yr/olds in my state). Luckily the police cruiser at the gas station he was filling up in talked him down. He was still my closer parent, we went golfing together and ran 5ks and swam together. Mum is a bit of a close minded, anal woman who tends to be scared of things outside her comfort zone which largely includes church and typical nice safe family activities, not terribly exciting for a teenager. Anywho after getting kicked out I crashed on a friends couch for about 6 months (stopped talking to my parents altogether) and picking up hours at work (roughly 40-50 per week) and ended up moving into an apartment (started slowly talking to them again)with a kid from high school whom I have no real common interests other than smoking weed (Id even say he can be unpleasant pretty quickly) and a work buddy of his, also started attending comm. college to try and get into a uni. Resulting in no real friends or people to talk in depth too. Ended up smoking waay too much weed for the first 6 months living there(possible cause of social anxiety?). Started to cool it down, que Dads death. So I guess the result is me having spent the large part of my teenage youth bouncing between intense home conflict and somewhat lax school setting, then after getting kicked out spending really all of my time either making unhealthy decisions or stressing out over too much work or school or any variety of things. Still going to community, my gf used to give me concerned talks about our respective schooling futures and express her excessive concern to try and motivate me but eventually ended uo realizing it was just weakening our relationship and stressing me out unnecessarily. Im going to end the rant now tho, Im sure you all get the picture. If anyone takes the time to read all this comments and ideas are welcome.

I have a problem and I don’t know what it is what to ask for help for and how to fix me.
It seems I can never sleep at night no matter what I try. I just keep thinking of all the bad things in my life and it seems to get worse until I freak out and have panic attack and try to wake my wife up to talk to her but al l do is yell at her and blame her for everything, when it’s not her fault.
We recently used to do a lot of cocaine and MDMA and smoke weed. We have since stopped all this as I thought this was the cause and everything would go away only to find out it got far worse. Now I know that when quitting this will get worse before they get better. We were not addicts but did it at least once every second weekend when the kids were gone. It was our release from the world of stress around us.
I love my wife more than anything I have ever loved. She truly is my soul mate. It just seems that when we get out of the whole life just kicks me in the ass and we get kicked back to the bottom of the barrel.
I have struggled with drugs my whole life and at this point will never ever again try anything of the sort or I will be going to rehab.
I know a lot of people struggle in life with problems and mine might seem like nothing but I can’t stop.
I lost my job almost a year ago in the IT field. No I have been on unemployment for this time. Now I sit at home and try to apply for jobs but when I get interviews I cancel them and freak out that I won’t be able to do the job and panic. I have never been this way I have always been amazing at interviews and talking to people.
I am turning forty this year and don’t have much to show for it. At this rate I will have to work all my life as we have no savings. I seem to get mad at everyone around me for problems that I caused or others. I seem to not be able to blame me and just move on. I get mad and yell at people and try and turn it around so it’s not me.
I stay awake at night unable to sleep I go four to five days with maybe four hours sleep. When I sleep I dream the most horrifying dreams possible and wake up with massive panic attacks.
I don’t hear voices in my head “YET”. But I do have big fights with myself in my head telling me how big a fuck up I am and why am I letting my family down this way. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, rather point me in the direction I can go to get me fixed and be the loving husband my wife and father my kids deserve.
I have a temper but I have worked very hard on my own to control it and now I just yell and get mad. I used to punch holes in the wall and through things. I know this is still not the best but it’s a start and I am going to an anger management class as soon as they have room for me.
I just want to know if I need medicine for this or if anyone else has had these problems.

I feel sad at the moment’s notice. Then I feel happy. Then something goes wrong and I got right to freak out mode. I just want to be normal so bad. I have contemplated suicide several times but love for my kids and wife keeps me alive as I can’t put them through that.
I’m not sure if I’m making sense I’m just trying to put the confusion in my head on paper to see if anyone else will understand.
Thank you for taking the time to read all this…..

I’m ready and willing to do anything at all to help me so I can be the father and husband my family deserves.

I cant feel or at least I think I don't feel love for anybody. Like most people say love is this or it's that but even if there wrong I guess they still kinda know what it is because they feel it. I don't think I love anybody in my family. Most prominently my parents but there also assholes so I guess that might be a reason. With my siblings I'm confused about whille I dont think I love them I also view them as extensions of me. Like I'm the oldest and I've already got there lives set and planned for them I dont see them as people per say but as things that I live through when I feel like it. I constantly daydream about our lives and I easily see myself as them as I would to me. When in reality they just seem like 2 dimensional figures and only interested in there live if it fits to what I want. I constantly forget that they have feelings and are human. Same thing with everybody around me I'm around them because I don't want to be lonely and I honestly don't care what happens to them as long as it does not affect me. One time my friend did not go to school because she was at the hospital and I hated her because she did it when it was my time. Same thing with all my other friends if they are not there at school when I am I take it as an attack On my needs and authority. Like how dare they get so selfish when I need them most, which is everyday until I don't. And when I hang out with them if there attention slips from me in the slightest I feel a deep resentment, but I don't call them out on it until I do which is frequently. I have a feeling that they know what I'm like and while I like playing with them about it I resent them because how dare something below me think they have me figured out. I honestly think that I've kind of corrupted them so they could at least for the life of me be bearable. I spend ours and if I have the time days thinking only about me and my needs. I think if you don't know me personally that when you see me that I'm just a normal person on the inside but as you can tell I'm not. The reason I know I'm not is because I watch people and can see that they are not like me. I get bored easily like really really easily. If I don't get stimulation I feel like the world is ending. I absolutely love attention, good intention because I don't deserve bad ones. I'm straight forward about this and an example is that one time I was just eating something and felt like I wasn't getting attention so I looked straight forward to my friend and told her to look at me. She looked at me but still said something about me being conceited and I was pleased. I'm tired and will be posting pt 2 when I feel like it.

Truthfully I don't even know if I feel good or bad most of the time. I thought I'd build a list of things that I do differently than most people I'm around, maybe you could offer some advice.

* I usually take at least 2 hours to fall asleep and usually sleep for about 12 hours.
* I rarely eat more than once a day, usually because I forget or don't feel like it
* I get drunk and/or high about once every two days
* I spend at least 90% of my time alone
* When I am with people (usually to drink) people tend to say I'm ""extreme"". Like I either am into things 150% or not at all.
* Despite that, I'm usually a pretty cool guy to be with. I've always had an easy time making ""friends"" and most people who know me like me. Those who don't would probably be happy to.
* I don't break my workload into manageable pieces. I like to work for days and nights straight without anything but coffee and then sleep for the rest of the week.
* I'm unable to be in a relationship. For some reason I only get turned on by women who already are in a relationship or women that are way out of my league. I tried dating a really cute girl a few weeks ago, but as soon as sex became ""normal"" I couldn't get hard anymore and I left her. I had no problem sleeping with my friend's girlfriend though.
* For some reason, I have a really hard time saying the truth to people. I lie about things that don't even matter, like the date of my next exam or what was my last meal and I don't know why. There are a few people that I trust and know that they won't care if I tell them the truth though.
* I used to do a lot of vandalizing and other stuff you don't wanna know about, especially when drunk and especially as a younger teen. Now I usually just get myself into bar fights somehow but try to be more careful, soon I'm going to have a professional reputation to keep.

I mean I don't know I want to keep going but I'm just making myself look like a terrible person. I witnessed a pretty traumatizing event when I was about 11, when my friend's family was killed by his step-father in a murder-suicide in his house while we were playing video games in the basement. No idea why he left us be like that, but my friend suicided a week later and the next few years were a big ""wtf"" for me. I caused a lot of family/school problems. 

I think that growing up with what must have been some kind of depression is what shaped my personality into what it is right now. When I feel good, I feel better than everyone, like no one's worth my time. When I feel bad, I literally hate every single person I have to interact with to get my day done. Needless to say that motivation to get through college isn't easy to come by.

A good way to describe and understand me is this: the only things that matter to me are what's directly in front of me. If I'm talking to a girl, I probably won't remember that I have a girlfriend unless she's right next to me. Or say, if there's no police around, I won't even feel like police officers exist. I'm not very violent and agressive by nature though, it's just I'm very often inappropriate.

I tried opening up a little to my friends because I do realize that I'm a little more different than the ""everybody's different"" boundaries allow, but a lot of the time they freak out or react badly and it just leaves me with the same awkward feeling of inadequacy I've been feeling all my life. I hate being judged or critized and it often feels like the only activities I can do safely is be on the computer or drink alone in my room, which is almost all of what I've been doing with my free time over the last 3 or 4 years.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,[Not Informative] Help?

So I am sort of a hypochondriac, I have often made something out of nothing but I am aware of this and try to be as objective as possible to avoid this. I am a female, 18 and in college. I have been struggling with relationships and identity and things lately. I have been pulling away from my closest friends because I felt like they were replacing me and treating me differently from their newer friends that came into the picture.

I started hanging out with new people that I recently met and I like them a lot but I feel like I am being clingy with them- I'm aware of this but I can't seem to pull myself away from them and I just met them 2-3 weeks ago. When they casually mentioned how I was around an awful lot (I don't think they meant anything by it) I got really offended. Even though I was aware that I shouldn't be offended I couldn't shake the feeling. Also, I felt really bad the rest of the day, kind of like I was angry with myself for being how I am, but again even though I was aware of it and the irrationality I couldn't shake it. Knowing that I was being irrational made me even more frustrated with myself.

Anyone know anything about BPD and willing to help me out? Information, personal experiences, or even your take on my situation would be helpful. I'm sorry it's long and possibly irrelevant I just don't know what to do.

Tl;dr, I feel like I have some symptoms of BPD and because I know I try to diagnose myself a lot I'm trying to be objective and it still fits. Thoughts?

P.S. I know I should try to see a therapist but I am in ROTC and don't want to risk getting disqualified for the military because of something that may not even be an issue. Thanks so much guys!

About a month ago I went on a date with someone who I met online. We met for coffee and it went fantastically, we both seemed enthusiastic about seeing each other more, and it turned into us seeing each other quite regularly. We have been doing typical date like things, but also have been hooking up as well (I would say 50/50). Anyways, I am moving about 2 hours away, but felt like the connection we have is too good to let die. We met yesterday to talk it over and he revealed that he has some pretty intense depression, and feels as if he can't give me what I need. It was just really sad to hear because a) the depression isn't something that scares me away in any way and b) the things he was listing that were negative about himself I see as positives. I dunno if I should just give it up , or wait it out for him to come out to the other side of the stuff he is currently going through.

I feel actual physical pain witnessing the pain of other people.  It is worse when it is someone I care about.  Because of this I have started doing random things to help people who cannot ever repay me, like strangers and stuff.

I can imagine that most people would not see this as a problem, but the truth is that I do these things without regard for my current situation.  For example, I had a friend who went through a bad breakup.  I gave him $1000 to help him move and start a new life.  I did this knowing that I didn't have an extra $1000 and then a month later it put me in the position that I had to borrow money to survive.

I have been to a cognitive behavioral therapist and she suggested to offer advice instead of resources.  So instead of giving someone money, teach them how they can get money in a pinch.  While this corrects the action, it doesn't turn off the thoughts and emotions.

I have had the opportunity to get involved with something that I would like to share with you. A friend of mine is starting a project called Mind Memoirs. The idea behind it is that mental health is often an uncomfortable subject that many people don't understand, and it is important to raise awareness of the ways people all around us have been affected by a mental illness. We would like to help people understand a variety of mental illnesses, from depression to anxiety, ADHD to PTSD, depersonalization to phobias, addiction to bipolar, and everything in between. The intention is to gather anonymous stories from all over and then perform them as monologues, spoken word poetry, and short sketches, in order for viewers to connect with sufferers of mental illness on an emotional level. We'd like viewers to see that anyone can be a sufferer, and that mental illness does not need to be taboo. Mind Memoirs is starting as a university level project in the US, but we are looking to showcase all kinds of stories about all kinds of mental health experiences from all over the world. We hope that the project will eventually expand, but for now we are collecting stories for an initial performance later this quarter. We are collecting stories until May 10th, and they can be submitted to mindmemoirs@yahoo.com. Stories will always be handled respectfully and anonymously. If you would like to participate, or simply to spread the word, we would be extremely grateful. Thanks for reading!",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,share your story about mental illness

The symptoms of HOCD seemed to apply to everything I was feeling, and also OCD explained my fear in the past of contracting AIDs from needles planted in public transport seats. After the initial spike in HOCD subsided I was feeling invigorated and incredibly happy, but it has returned in a much more sinister form (pedophilia). I know from the previous good times that I am straight, nor a pedophile, but this does not stopped my intrusive thoughts. I have always combated this with testing myself in my head, should I resist these 'tests' and what sort methods should I try.  I have read about CBT, but nothing I have read has been clear on particular techniques. I feel quite embarrassed and ashamed so have not seen a doctor, I have told my girlfriend about the HOCD and she is sympathetic and supportive which has no doubt been the biggest help. I know I should tell a doctor, but I guess I'm afraid they wont agree with the conclusions I have come to. Thank you for reading.

Lately I've been feeling like I'm just ignored all the time. I work for a blog that gives advice about mental health issues, and most of us have disorders ourselves, and use a facebook group to talk to each other. Sometimes we post about feelings like ""I'm feeling triggered today, _______ just happened"" or ""therapy tomorrow..."" and usually it starts a whole comment thread when someone else posts, but when I try to ask for a little support, I'm lucky to get one person who says ""hang in there.""

 A little backstory first, I'm 16 and since I was born I've lived with my grandparents. They raised me so naturally I refer to them as my mom and dad. My biological parents were drug users, or at least my mother was, I don't know much about my father. He (biological father) died when I was two years old. 

  When I was around eight years old my mom told me about my biological parents and that my father died when I was two. I don't remember very much of my childhood but I do remember being very upset about this. My mom said I didn't talk to her for days. I guess it was like learning that the two parents I knew and loved weren't actually my real parents and that they were lying to me. I love my parents very much and don't feel much of a connection to my biological parents. But at that time it hit me hard, I was only eight. Eight year olds aren't equipped to process that sort of information.

  When I was around the same age (at least I think, I have a hard time connecting memories with times) I remember having a particularly troubling intrusive thought. It just popped into my head and I couldn't get it out no matter how hard I tried. It was of killing my dad. I won't go into detail but that's it. I remember locking myself in the bathroom acting like I was taking a shower but I was really having a sort of emotional breakdown (Remember I was 8-10 y.o. here). I was crying and it was awful and I just couldn't believe I would ever think something like that. 

  I was thinking about all of this today and realized these two memories might be connected. Were these intrusive thoughts caused by learning that my dad was in fact not my real dad? I don't know, I guess I'm just venting here. I've never told anyone this.

I am considering going to the doctor to get ritalin. I have a form of ADHD involving sensory overstimulation as well as anxiety [resulting from the overstimulation] and OCD [primarily obsessional, if something is able to hold my attention span it will hold it four hours; I often perform repetitive tasks or will read an entire book in a day if it's interesting enough, and I also have a few compulsions such as rocking in place or clenching my fists or washing my hands with hand sanitizer if made nervous].  Yes, I do have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist for these that was made when I was 8. 

I work part time at Target right now and don't have much money to spare, but my ADHD and anxiety due to overstimulation is really interfering with my ability to work. It will get to where I can't even count change if I 'm on a register just because everything around me is vying for cognitive space. Does anyone have any idea how much it costs to get generic ritalin? If it's 100$+ a month I'll not even bother because I can't afford that. I have no insurance and the Affordable Healthcare Act was unable to help me get any due to my state apparently not participating despite me being eligible for free insurance, so I can't afford treatment if it's not cheap. Also, would my family doctor be able to prescribe it? I like my family doctor and he's really nice so I feel like I could tell him about these issues but I don't know if a psychiatrist has to write psychiatric prescriptions.

I appreciate any help anyone can offer. (For the record, I do not respond well to Adderall, so I don't think Vyvanse would be good, but Ritalin worked fine.

The problem is that one of my close friends is really going through crisis right now, and I don't feel like I can support her and stay safe myself.

So I was diagnosed with depression about 12 weeks ago after having gone to therapy for 4-6 weeks beforehand. The doc put me on zoloft and gave me some adderall as well.

Things haven't changed much. I'd say I am more rational and recognize I have habits I need to change. But I don't really have the motivation to change my habits. 

This is because I just constantly feel ""meh"" not AWFUL. So I don't want to leave my comfort zone to change things that bad...but I know I should so I can start to feel better than meh.

This alone leads me to believe I don't have depression- or at least the depression is a result of something underlying.

My ""symptoms""

- Difficulty falling asleep, difficulty waking up
- Large appetite
- Inability to concentrate on mundane tasks, so homework is a beach because I see it as busy work when in reality it truly is getting me closer to my goals
- I have goals but I am not motivated to reach them. I know I want to be an Air Force Engineer Officer with a great body who travels the world and plays guitar. But I don't do much to reach my goals. 
- Everything feels very mechanical, I think a little of that has to do with the fact that I hold back on what I want to do (probably because of anxiety) so I am working on ""just doing it"" aka going in for the kiss, asking for the number, asking people to hang out.

Of course I will try to talk with my doctor, but I am unfortunately off at college so it is a bit difficult. 

As of now, my dad, who is a therapist, brought up I may have sluggish cognitive tempo ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo ). SCT totally hits on all of my symptoms. So I am thinking of trying to get on Wellbutrin or Strattera, Intuniv (Guanificine) and Modafinil (Specifically Nuvigil). 

Been in cognitive behavioral therapy but without the motivation to do things outside of therapy it is useless. I feel like I need to do neurofeedback therapy. 

And finally, I think I should check out getting my sleep tested. See if I have sleep apnea or some kind of sleep disorder. Perhaps that is where it all stems from. Also heard hypothyroidism is a possibility. 

One last thing is that I was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency as a child so perhaps I have low dopamine. 

But all I want to know is if anyone has had a similar experience and what they did to fix their issues.

- Depression Test: track scores over time
- Guided Audio/Video: mindfulness meditation, stress relaxation, skills training
- CBT: Modules that help you challenge distorted thoughts with common cognitive distortions. Cognitions diary. Gratitude Journal

I'll try and condense this, because otherwise it's gonna be a life story.

I'm a transgender woman, have gone through the surgery. I live comfortably with my (nearly) husband, and have a decent family life.

Around five years ago I started getting seriously stressed. I was very afraid of dying. Eventually that turned into a fear of having health problems. At which point I started having pretty bad palpitations. That became panic attacks. Which became hypochondria.

Eventually it all started to cascade around late 2012, where I would be feeling my heart rate about 500 times a day. Terrified of it moderately changing. I was also prone to wanting to do things.. but failing to fulfill any daily tasks. I'd sit there curled up in a ball, saying ""do stuff! go to the bathroom! go cook! ... do your freaking homework!"" and I would look at these things like a great behemoth.

Fast forward to now, I have had multiple ER visits where the most I've ever had reported is ""You have slightly low potassium..."" after days of non stop panic attacks. I spend most of my day curled up, trying not to think. And whenever I leave the house, depending on what I'm doing, where I'm going, I will suffer different reactions. My heart rate goes to 140 in the shower. Goes to 140 walking around campus, but stays pretty low walking around anywhere else. Goes stupidly high when in train stations. And in my lecture today, I lost my mind a little. I felt this weird sensation up in my nose. Started smelling something as if it was burning, and it was very potent. I'd had it before, but nothing nearly as bad. I stifled a scream, packed up my stuff, and GTFO'd. Heart rate, of course, going crazy.

I am terrified my heart isn't working properly. It's my every waking moments' concern. And I don't understand how me having an emotional concern could possibly lead to rates expected of major exercise when just climbing stairs. I've had lots of tests.. all of them come back with no problem.

I don't understand how it can cause me to lay there at night (sometimes) desperately breathing for oxygen, turning over and my heart missing beats.

And I don't understand why every time a member of online communities, such as chat rooms or game servers I've been a long member of, have scolded me, I can barely even breathe. The feeling is indescribably stressful.

I've also become pretty abusive lately.. I don't know why, but I have like.. 20 throwaway accounts online where I'll just do my utmost to piss people off. And then I'll spend just as long crying about it, and telling myself off for being a colossal douche. After I spend a lot of time feeling absolutely terrible, this is what I choose to do.

I don't know what's going on. I've spent the last 10 years of my life battling being trans. Since I had surgery.. my brain is absolutely free of those concerns. It's been rather liberating.

Have a background of mental illness in my family, My sister and 3 cousins are Autistic(Aspergers) , she also suffers from ADHD/Obsessive Compulsive. Older people have suffered from Anxiety and Schizophrenia. I was lucky to not be born with any of these. Around high school I started to get extreme social anxiety, I still get it occasional especially when meeting new people or doing public speaking. With the use of Propranalol it is managed. I have in the past experiences mild Auditory hallucination, not as of recent though. 

As of lately I have had an inability to sit still or perform any tasks effectively. Constantly my mind wanders, I often find myself talking to myself within my head and staying on task seems impossible. I am in a very important part of my schooling, I have managed to perform well so far but this feeling continually keeps happening. The best way to describe it is something ""building up"" inside of me, until I can't take it anymore, and need to move around of change tasks. It has become very distracting. And feels very uncomfortable fighting this ""feeling""

Regardless, I am hesitant to talk to my parents as of yet. They go through lot with my sisters mental illness and I do not wish to scare them and add to their problems. Before I do talk to them, can anyone think of this ""feeling"" I am experiencing? I know it is very vague.

Background: Suffered from social anxiety, mild Auditory hallucination. Have experimented with Alcohol, Marijuana and Synthetic Marijuana. But have not done so in the past 16 months.

Thanks",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Weird Feelings. Can anyone help?

We weren't just a fling, we lived together and she was my first girlfriend and first kiss when I was 14. The end of our relationship was drawn out over the last couple months and involved her cheating with and leaving me for my former ""best friend"". 

I can't stop seeing her in my head. When I close my eyes, I visualize them having sex; and it makes me SO sick that I run to the bathroom and throw up. I've thrown up multiple times everyday, day after day. I can't sleep, and when I take pills to sleep, I dream. When I dream, I dream about her and I, and I wake up with the most horrid knot in my stomach. I try to eat, especially when there is a good meal to be eaten, but just can't. I'm shedding weight fast, throwing up constantly, can't sleep, and feel totally helpless to my feelings of loss. I can't help this, no matter how much I try to meditate, take deep breaths, or picture stop signs. I talk about it with my mom, and it makes me feel good as I talk, but then it passes when the conversation is over, and I'm sick again. I let my feelings flow, I've let it all out numerous times and broken down, which numbs me for a few minutes, but doesn't stop the pain. I'm aware I deserve better treatment, and I know I am helpless to what has happened as she makes her own decisions. This does not ease it, however. I have a history of passing out due to stress, along with weird heart rate fluctuations. 

Is this part of a larger, mental health problem? Or do I just need to wait for more time to pass before I can control the entirety of my thoughts in order to stabilize my mental and physical health?

A lot of the family that was related to her that we are now back in touch with range from slightly overweight, to stuck in a wheelchair fat, but no one is thin. I myself am overweight and have very, very addictive tendencies. 

Now, I have had slight rage issues, but normally it's provoked by something. I'm bad with video game rage, so I stopped playing them as much. I'd break controllers and stuff like that, just instant white-hot fury blows through me. Sometimes I'd slap and smack my own head and immediately regret it after, sometimes I'd give myself a bruise even. I don't cut, not suicidal though I think about the logistics of it, like why and how people do it, and why I would ever do it, but I know I wouldn't. I love my family and friends and would not take that route, ever.

But today was different, and was the first time I was genuinely concerned about my lack of control over myself. I woke up as per usual, wasn't hungover or anything. Woke up in just a rage, I kicked my legs up and down. I punch the walls. Talk to myself angrily, and just threw some small things around. I would talk myself down so to speak and then just get wound back up. It was the first time I thought, ""Why is this happening, and what is really wrong with me?""

20 male, single mom, one sister. Father distant in-out of jail, physically and emotionally abused by mother until 14 years old. Father died at 15.
I have a problem / extreme anxiety in regards to people caring about me that I have become self aware thanks to my ex girlfriend / relationship. Although this will involve my ex girlfriend quite a bit I don't think this should be posted to relationship advice because that's not what I'm seeking. My ex gf had the tendency to get upset or into a bad mood and go silent, want some alone time or in certain situations just want to be cuddled. In all of our bad fights she will display a characteristic that I would interpret as her not caring about me. This will cause me to feel sad, frustrated, and give me high anxiety. If it continues past a threshold I will completely lose control of my emotions swinging from extreme to extreme with no idea what is happening to me inside. Our breakup and time alone made me remember an event from grade 7 when I had a school meeting with my teacher, mother, councilor and principle. I was asked a question along the lines of “what is the problem at home?” which I started crying and replied I just want someone to care about me. After I remember this I had the longest breakdown to date and put every piece of the puzzle together of how my childhood is extremely affecting my personal life and relationships.  This realization has caused me to become aware of every little thing I’ve done in my past relationship that I didn’t understand and thought was caused by my ex-girlfriend to be all bottled up emotions inside of me.
I went to the doctor today and got a referral to a therapist. I beg for any advice / help on managing these emotions or correcting this. I can’t stand the thought of hurting people due to my past. Could this be borderline personality disorder? Please ask any questions you need to understand me more thoroughly.

I'm transgender, along with being severely mentally ill.  Let me just go ahead and say that because of severe mental illness and lack of court filing fees that I need, I have not legally changed my name to James yet.  However, from my very first contact with  the admissions advisers, they were aware that they were not to refer to me by my dead name when calling me, emailing me, or anything else.  I knew that I would have to apply under and have my financial aid docs under my dead name, but was assured all else would be fine.  And, when they made my user name to log into the student website James.Butler.187, I thought all was well.  For the most part it seemed ok, and then I would notice in campus email that every now and then I'd have to change it back to James from my dead name, my Office account was under my dead name, I'd get called my dead name in class because it was on the student roster  and have to go on a long rant where I essentially had to out myself on the class message boards and risk humiliation in order to correct it.  It was on my student profile for god and everyone to see.
Then, the emails started with the wrong name in them.  And, the phone calls.  And, I know they knew they were not to refer to me by that name because they had called me dozens of times during the admissions process, and after the first explanation, it hadn't been an issue.  And, then suddenly, it was.  
I am already severely mentally ill.  I have schizoeffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, Aspergers syndrome, ADHD, plus the trans issues, and speech/hearing impairments because of a cleft lip/palate.  I'm fighting an uphill battle hill as it is.  I told them that what they were doing was causing me a great deal of mental distress.  I got to the point where I couldn't log into the student site, open emails from them, or answer their phone calls because of the severe dysphoria it caused me.  I just started T 4 months ago and am really starting to look masculine and, so for someone to take that away from me in some way hurts a lot.  They said there was nothing they could do to change it.  That they wanted to be supportive but the only option they offered in support was the option to withdraw.  I ended up getting dropped from the school because the environment felt so hostile to me and made me so mentally unstable and dysphoric that I didn't get to participate at all because I couldn't even log on to class or even risk communicating with them at all because I was so close to hospitalization and completely non-functional over this.  I just wanted the same chance that everyone else got.  Turns out I just discovered one more institutions that would be happier if I just didn't exist.  They didn't care what they were doing to me as a trans man, and they didn't care what they were doing to me as someone who was severely mentally ill.  I want to be able to get off disability and work some day.  I think I can only do that if I get a degree, but it seems like, at least from this experience, the world would just be happier if I just went away all together.  I want CTU to suffer for making me suffer so badly.

I try not to discuss these things with my family or friends because most of them wouldn't understand or would just criticize me, and the ones who would understand would probably be really stressed out. So I hope you don't mind me venting here.

I have some issues, I don't really know what they all are but they've been plaguing me for a very long time. I'm 24 now, and I've been diagnosed with ADD (although I think that's just one of the problems I have). When I was younger, I was diagnosed with depression, but all of the various medications I was put on seemed to have unbearable side effects, to the point where I'd have to take 2-3 other types of medication to cancel them out. It ended up just making me worse, and got so severe that I just quit taking medication altogether. My most recent psychiatrist INSISTED that I had some sort of depression disorder, and was really pushy about me taking medication for it again. I refused, since a lot of the ones he suggested sounded very familiar and I didn't want to go through all that again. I stopped taking my medication for ADD as well (I was on adderall) because I realized I was starting to need higher doses and literally could not function at all if I forget even one pill. I didn't want to become completely dependent on it, so I slowly just weaned myself off and stopped going to my psychiatrist (which was probably a bad idea, but I really hated him anyway). I also have anxiety disorder, which runs in my family. Basically, I'm an unmedicated, barely-functioning mess.

I've been working on and off for years, usually full time but sometimes part time. I've attempted to go to college, but have only completed a year and I have a tendency to panic and drop classes. I'm always really excited when I start a new job, but after three months or so I just lose interest and start to feel miserable. The job I have currently, I've had for about 6 months now... and I honestly have no complaints about the job itself. I work in an office, I don't really have to deal with customers much at all (which is a huge plus, I absolutely hate customer service). My job really isn't all that complicated and the pay is okay. I'm prone to having panic attacks at work for no reason, but have done my best to hide this from my coworkers. When it gets really bad, I'll take a smoke break and then return to my desk and attempt to calm myself down while still trying to get my work done. There's been two times where I just couldn't do it, during the more severe attacks I can't even read, it's like my mind suddenly can't process simple things because it's too busy panicking. I've had a couple days where I had to invent some sickness and go home early, and I feel awful about lying but I also feel that anxiety/mental health problems are looked down on in workplaces.

This has happened in pretty much every job I've had, and always ends up with me quitting, whether I'm on medication or not. That's not to say that I don't want to work and make a living, because I do. I just feel so trapped and helpless when I'm working to make a lot of money for a company, who in turn just kicks back a tiny little portion to me. I can't stand the thought that I HAVE to wake up at this time, I HAVE to get to work at this time, I HAVE to be there all day no matter how beautiful it is outside, and when I leave the sun will be going down and I'll have just enough time to eat dinner and straighten up the house before going to bed and then doing it all over again. I know that no one really LIKES having to do all that, but with me it just gets to the point where it's unbearable. It stresses me out, and it makes me kind of hate my life. I have no time to do things that I enjoy, like gardening and drawing (which helps with my depression and anxiety).

I took the day off work today, and I can't tell you how liberated and amazing I feel. I have gotten so many things done that I've needed to do for quite a long time. For just today I feel free, but I'm already feeling dread that I have to go into work tomorrow. I do understand that I need to have some sort of income in order to survive, but I think I might want to look for a job where it's commission-based or something with no set hours. I think my main problem with regular jobs is the forced schedule.

Sometimes I just feel really overwhelmed with the things society expects me to do, and I feel like I'm wasting my life away at jobs that are just making me sicker.

I have a friend who is not super close but that I care about.
For as long as I have known him (10+ years) I have felt that something is off with him. The way he uses alcohol, the way he focuses on things for periods of time and looses track and other small things.
A while back he told me that he had had a breakdown and had to get institutionalized for a few days and got some medication. He thinks he is bi-polar and I have no reason to think that this is not true.
I talk to him from time to time and the medication does not seem to help. He has a lot of angst and feels ""he can not live like this any longer"".
He seems to be thinking about suicide. He have not said it out loud and I did not want to be blunt and ask. I got the feeling he wanted to hint at it without saying it.
This situation is new to me. 
I do want to help him as he is a good guy.
So how do I support him?
Do I call him more often (from once a week) or do I ""give him space"".
He is unemployed but I got some stuff I can pay him to do, is this a good thing or a stresser?
The self medication that he does with alcohol, do I just let that slide even when it might hurt others?

This seems as good a place as any to reach out to the community and get some advice on some issues. It's a bit of a long story, I'll try to make it as brief as possible, so bear with me.

The family member in question is a parent. My parents split up when I was young (my older sister was teenaged at the time). There is an avid hate of my father, who I moved out to live with when I turned 18. My sister and her (now ex-) husband moved out here the year or two before. She's been remarried for almost two decades now, to a husband so is incredibly patient and generally awesome. 

She was previously misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, and had cancer before I was born (and survived). In recent years she has been diagnosed with PTSD and a rather fatal heart condition, those are the main things that I am aware of. I somewhat suspect by the things she says that she might also have Paranoid Personality Disorder.

I can see why bipolar might have been a misdiagnosis, however. My stepfather after first marrying her called the police, he was so concerned by one of her sudden outbursts of violence and anger. And over the course of days, it can come and go, but triggered by who-knows-what. The second-to-last time I went to visit them, I mentioned I had seen a couple that I knew were friends with my father, but I thought had been friends with her. Apparently not, apparently they were backstabbing hurtful scheming people who, now that I had told them she was living in the area, would be sure to tell all the other backstabbing hurtful scheming people where she lived and her peace and quiet was over. Before this time, I wasn't even permitted to tell my Father what city she lived in.

Well on that night, I got ripped to shreds for trying to defend why I had done it. To tears and beyond, it was only my stepfather who stopped me from packing my bags and leaving for the airport, ready to just camp out until my flight left a few days later if I had to. Things were tense the next few days, nothing else was said, just pure silence and avoidance, and then it was all fine. She gave me a hug and apologized, and though things were tense, we functioned again until I left.

I was able to visit them again recently while on a work trip. A short couple of hours that I had, but my stepdad told me afterwards that she had been saying since that last trip that she was never going to see me again, that she'd lost me, and was so happy I was able to come visit, even just for a little while.

But in conversation, the wrong word will suddenly make you the most hurtful, scheming person in existence. I asked my stepdad how he deals with it, and TL;DR, he sees her for the person she really is. I try hard to, and there's always that part of me that knows she's in there, that the apologies afterwards are true recognition that she's hurt someone. But when you're under fire, I find it nearly impossible to tell myself that the things coming from her mouth aren't her true feelings, that its just an illness. There's always the misunderstanding of mental illness, and in this case, I definitely can see where it comes from. 

I write this right now because my sister is currently under fire. She wrote an extensive email detailing recent life, and that after a long and painful divorce, she's found someone she likes. I don't know all the details, me and my sister are both rather reserved and quiet people (even to each other when it comes to personal issues; which makes dealing with our mother even harder), but I know that there's been a couple of emails sent to her with a threatening ""we need to talk"" sort of tone that we both know from experience is not going to be a happy talk. It's going to be one full of angry words and our mother isn't going to be the first one to break down. She's now said she's going to call tonight at a specific time to have said discussion.

In emails and phone calls, I've tried everything to resolve a situation. I've attacked back (a terrible idea, but I was emotional at the time), said nothing at all (which only encourages a ""why haven't you answered? I'm going to call you now to find out""), tried to reason (there's no reasoning to be had, any valid points are ignored or twisted against you).

I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do, I always just close my eyes and ride it out, try not to let it affect my life too much. I've been desperately depressed during days like that, and I know my sister is tough, but not up against this. I want to be able to at least console my sister, but I can't even do that.

I put it out to you guys, what do I do? I love our mother, she's the most fun, amazing, awesome woman in existence when she's in a good mood, but when the other side takes over, I struggle to hold on. 

Halp.

This led me suffering from anxiety everyday In fear that something I did or my mum did could send him into a rage of anger. I'm now 28 and I have for years suffered from anxiety and I have recently been told I suffer from ptsd.

I have recently been seeing a psychologist and she has been explaining that there are chemicals that are released when someone goes through something like pstd and anxiety and are subject to constant stressful situations. I have been researching this and the chemical cortisol. I was obviously under stress a lot as a child and this chemical would of been released all the time as a child along with adrenaline. I have been reading that this can actually affect the way someones brain develops by shrinking the Hippocampus.

I'm wondering if my brain has no doubt shrunk. When I was at school I was told that I was student who showed Promise but never bothered to put any effort in because I was to busy being naughty and trying to take my anger out on the teachers. I also always found it hard to concentrate for to long and felt like I always used to forget what I learned easily. Even til this day if I learn a word that is quite complex or long I seem to forget it in a few days. It's the same with maths. If I learn something mathematical I will literally forget it a few days later. When taught something though I can normally learn it quite quickly and solve it perfectly fine it's just a waste of time because I forget it.

My question is am I permanently damaged now? My life has been a roller coaster! I have always been in minimum wage jobs and never had a social life. I'm 28 and finally getting professional help. I want to start taking adult education to improve my english grammar and maths and then business studies. My concern is will I even be able to remember anything I learn. Is there any point because my brain is now damaged? I'm still an extremely anxious person who is releasing cortisol everyday. Now the damage is done is it irreversible? Is there anything I can do to improve my memory and cognitive function? How can I stop releasing so much cortisol into my blood stream? are there types of medication to help control this or will the EMDR therapy I'm about to go through help with this?

I'm not sure if this was the right board to post this in but as you can see I want to improve my life but the more I read about the damaging effects of going through ptsd as a child it seems very doom and gloom and I guess I'm looking for some sort of hope.

Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait characterized by anxiety, moodiness, worry, envy, and jealousy. Individuals who score high on neuroticism are more likely than the average to experience such feelings as anxiety, anger, envy, guilt, and depressed mood. They respond more poorly to stressors, are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They are often self-conscious and shy, and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying gratification. Neuroticism is a risk factor for the ""internalizing"" mental disorders such as phobia, depression, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders, all of which are traditionally called neuroses. 

I have symptoms such as: anxiety, depression, irritability, mental confusion, low sense of self-worth, phobic avoidance, vigilance, impulsive and compulsive acts, lethargy, cognitive problems such as unpleasant or disturbing thoughts, repetition of thoughts and obsession, habitual fantasizing, negativity and cynicism, perfectionism, schizoid isolation, socio-culturally inappropriate behaviors, etc.


So, I'm just wondering if being neurotic can be considered a normal state for some and if this is just going to be my state forever? I'm 19 and I've been like this for my entire life. I've kind of come to accept it and to appreciate my quirks since most people find me outrageously funny and I know some people make careers out of being neurotic (Thom Yorke for one).

I'm looking for some advice, to help deal with a bad family situation...
this is mainly addressed to anyone who lives in South East England.


To put it succinctly, my Mum (in her 90's) has been very poorly, physically, over the past three years. 
She was always a very active woman, but her various illnesses have rendered her practically immobile
(she also suffers from age-related macular degeneration, which means that she is sight-impaired.)
Whilst she has faced these circumstances with great fortitiude, it has become apparent that her tendency
towards mild depression (something she has always had) has started to worsen, 
to the extent that I feel she needs to seek professional help.

Her Doctor has been excellent as regards her physical ailments, but is no good when it comes to mental
health (his standard methods would only involve further medication.)
My family are doing their best, but this situation is beyond our knowledge, and I am putting this request out
to see if anyone has any suggestions as to getting some counselling for my Mum. 
I am sure that if she were able to 'offload' some of the negativity she is experiencing at the moment, she would feel SO much better.

Thing is, my folks are not rich, so I wonder if there would be any chance of getting such help at a 'local health authority' level.
They DO have excellent healthcare in the area, so it would just be a question of knowing who to approach, outside of their existing
medical support.

My brother's always on here and sings its praises so thought I'd give it a try.

So here goes.

My father built his home right across from a massive park, so as soon as I was big enough, I would spend all day in the park with my mother, grandmother or other family member. This park was massive and had everything a kid could ask for. Swings, slides, jungle gyms etc...

My father's home was situated in a small town where everyone knew everyone else and looked out for one another. So when I grew older, my mother didn't freak out when I started going to the park on my own. It was right across our house after all.

Now the thing about this park is that there's a wood attached right next to it. It's separated by a fence but a kid could squeeze through at a point.
I was a pretty social kid so I was friends with everyone. Now one day, I made friends with a group of older boys. The must have been 12 or 13 at the time. We start hanging out everyday and would play football or cricket every afternoon. So we got to be very close.

After a couple weeks, my youngest uncle bought this laser pointer with a lot of these lens on it which I thought was very cool. So I thought I'd take it and show it to my friends. Now of our group, only two other guys showed up that day. We had never rough-housed before that day but those guys and I start wrestling and just being very physical in our play. When it was time to go home, I realized the pointer was missing and my ""friends"" told me they'd seen a kid pick it up and take it into the woods. I decided to go in after the kid and the boys followed.

Once we were deep enough in the woods, the boys showed me they had the pointer and would ""trade"" me something for it. They then forced me to take off my pants and held me down as they took turns anally penetrating me. I don't know how long it went on for but by the time I left the woods, it was pretty dark.

Now, 17 years later, my life is confusing. After that incident, I became very alpha male but there was something wrong with the way I interacted with people. 

Whenever I meet someone new or unfamiliar, I clam up and would be physically intimidated by them. It doesn't matter whether they're young or old, male or female, I will be terrified of being alone with them anywhere.  
 
I have younger siblings but I am unable to interact with them properly and it's like that with the rest of my family. At family get-togethers, I would be on my own while everyone else is having a good time.

Being stuck in a social situation, like going in front of people to make a presentation or going on stage, has physically made me ill and people have said that they've noticed me physically shaking.

I hide in my bedroom all the time so I can be away from everyone. People try to talk to me but I shut them down.

I don't want this life anymore. I have contemplated suicide but I don't want to give up without trying first. I want to get better but I don't understand how. I've been to therapists but all they've done is give me medication that numbs me and makes me feel dead on the inside. I don't want to be the ""weird"" guy in the family everyone feels bad for and I don't want to be the kid my parents worry all the time for.

I want to go to university and be able to make friends without my heart feeling it might explode.

Can you please help?

* I took drugs (stimulants, such as mephedrone and mdma, and daily cannabis smoking) for 2 years (weed for longer). Now I've completely stopped, also stopped smoking

Didn't really help anyway and I see many posts saying they're almost useless anyway.

* After cutting all drugs didn't help, I tried exercise and even meditation (you should meet me, I'm the last person you'd ever expect to try meditation!). These also haven't helped.

* I make NO new friends. I attend many parties and meet a lot of people, I half get along with people (I feel no one hates me, no one actually likes me either, and I don't blame them, I wouldn't either when I try and picture myself in these situations).

She remained a normal weight through this but definitely wasn't healthy. Each obsession would last probably like 3 months or so - it would be things like only eating cereal bars, or only orange juice, or apples. 


When she went to university she sort of got over that when she met her boyfriend. She ate normally then and was the happiest I'd seen her last. She then broke up with him and her weird eating patterns came back.


Recently she has become vegan. I know you can be healthy and vegan, but she definitely isn't. She's very skinny, and doesn't eat any carbs. She is obsessed with health food and is working in a health food shop - she only eats totally unprocessed stuff. No rice, bread, any sort of grains or anything. It sort of makes me angry because she thinks she's healthy but she's so obviously not. She's really physically weak and has absolutely no energy or presence anymore.


 I'm lucky enough to not suffer from disordered eating largely anymore, and I am physically better looking and strong from playing sports and strength training, and so I know she is probably thinking from a very irrational place.

She does yoga and was telling me about how she didn't have the strength to hold a plank, and when demonstrating I saw her spine sticking out. It was disgusting.


Her idea of processed food is literally things that are still healthy and not bad, things like bread. She doesn't take supplements and is clearly very unhealthy.

I've tried to encourage him to get help and he won't. He says either he can't afford it or it's all brainwashing. Most of the time it's like talking to a wall, if you're even able to get a word in. He lives alone in a house and he doesn't have a job or many friends. I have a family friend that goes over and checks on him a couple times a week and he says the same things. I've even threatened to call the police when he's gotten really bad and he says he'll answer the door with an unloaded gun so they shoot him OR he'll leave a recording of him shooting himself on my voicemail.

The thing about my father is, he's very manipulative. I know mental health and suicide are things to be taken seriously but with how many times he says all this stuff and how aware he is, I almost feel like he is trying to guilt me or scare me into harassing my mother, which I won't do. And when I say no, he feels like he has no control. It's been like this my entire life with different things.

Hey everyone. I'm a 16 year old who has been suffering from increasingly worse depression over the last 2 or so years. In the past 1 and half, my symptoms have really began to affect my life significantly. Ever since I was bit by a tick back in May/June of 2012, these symptoms seemed to appear. At first, it was a stereotypical ""depression"" with peaks and low points. However, since winter of freshman year, I have become increasingly anhedonic on top of anxiety and constant lower stomach pain (where I was bit by the tick). I have only recently made the connection between the initial bite and the symptoms. I should also mention that I had a ""panic attack"" (probably not the right term) after pulling the tick out, which had been attached to my lower stomach for the better portion of a day. My skin turned ghost white, my thoughts were racing, and I felt as close to death as I ever have. This went away after about 10 minutes. Also, I have never had any form of mental instability, and have no family history of depression, minus from my father. The only health issues I have ever had before this were a lazy eye &amp; allergies to amoxicillin. When the anhedonia began to truly affect my heaviliy, I had never used any recreational or prescription drugs in my life. Now, I have drank a handful of times (not my thing) and smoke marijuana often as I have found it helps my stomach pains. However, I do not like the tiredness associated with the comedown as it often makes me more depressed, so I have been taking a break from it recently. I experimented with DXM about 3 times (stupid, I know), but that didn't seem to have any negative after effects.


By fall of 2013, my anhedonia had reached an incredibly low point, and I sought out help from a doctor. I was placed on an SSRI (Citalopram/Celexa 20mg a day) which somewhat alleviated the feelings of ""doom"" and ""tunnel vision"" I had been experiencing. However, after a few months I stopped and switched to Wellbutrin 150mg/day as the SSRI seemed to worsen my anhedonia.


Now, I feel as though my life is at a complete standstill. I have reached that point were literally NOTHING is ""fun"" or enjoyable. Music, my passion, has lost almost all of it's value to me. I cannot experience emotions like I used to, and let me explain that further. You know how when you see a movie/smell a scent/do an activity you have a certain emotion that you receive from it? That is completely gone for me. One of the most horrid sensations from this anhedonia is that I am unable to feel love or compassion for anyone. It just seems like my whole ""headspace"" has changed, and when I say that I mean that this feels entirely ""chemical"". This has made it incredibly hard to find answers for my anhedonia, because when doctors/psychiatrists hear ""depression"" they seem to think that it's resulting from a traumatic event, hardship, etc. For me, it's just a constant downward slope into the rabbit whole of emotional emptiness for the past 2 years. This is no way to live. If anyone has ANY sort of info that could help me out, that would be amazing.


A few more things to mention -


1) I have recently been prescribed Concerta 36mg/day for an inabilty to focus resulting from the anhedonia.


2) I had an ""existential crisis"" of sorts in 5th grade (not overreacting, it was very troubling for me) that lasted about a month.


3) My progression into emotional numbness has been a downward slope completely (minus a slight lull after beginning Citalopram and Wellbutrin), not like a typical ""depression"" with peaks and low points. For the most part I'm not ""depressed"", I just can't feel anything at all.


4) Occasionally, I will have moments of feeling. Although this sounds strange, I literally have moments every once in a while where I feel that my old life's headspace and feelings are starting to come back. A year ago, these would last minutes. Now, they are few and far between, and only last seconds.


5) I seem to have a constant, but very minor headache.


6) The stomach issue (which arose around the same time as the anhedonia) is a tight feeling in my lower stomach that never goes away. It is always there, and even drinking water will sometimes upset it.


7) Before starting Wellbutrin, I felt so tired ALL the time that I felt like the world was caving in. Going to class was incredibly tough.


8) I feel like my IQ has dropped significantly, and overall feel ""dumber"" and way less motivated.


Sorry about the wall of text. If anyone has any answers, please let me know. I have had psychiatrists and doctors test me for both the anhedonia and stomach problems, and I have had no resolutions for anything. I don't feel depressed or suicidal, just pure emptiness. I don't know what to do.


TL;DR I have been suffering from a constant, tight lower stomach pain and increasingly worse anhedonia over the past 2 years. These symptoms began at the same time after a tick bit me, which gave me a ""panic attack"" of sorts after pulling it out. Now, I have almost no emotional response to anything. Nothing is ""fun"" or ""exciting"", no matter how hard I try. I feel as though my entire ""headspace"" has changed since the bite, and my perception of the world is incredibly skewed, and I feel incredibly detached and depersonalized.

My step sibling can communicate, and most of the time can make rational decisions. I don't exactly know what her disorder is (and haven't asked as it's always a touchy subject with her), but she can be extremely immature in many situations. I know that it's probably related to her learning disorders, but I don't know exactly how. (Sorry if that isn't the most helpful peace of information.) I also know that it isn't entirely biological. From all reports, her natural mother was hell and her father frequently felt driven from the home because of it.  

She:
-Doesn't understand context and frequently acts on her misunderstanding.
-Is very demanding with things unrelated to her disabilities. Things in the home must be done a certain way, or she will be visibly upset.  
-Is verbally abrasive. Likes to call others out on almost anything.
-Projects her own abrasiveness onto others. Though I have never said anything deliberately hurtful to her, she has said in company that I shouldn't make fun of her.

If this were a normal person, I would have either been quit of them long ago or have some very terse and pertinent conversations. However, she doesn't really understand that everything she's doing is so completely infuriating sometimes. It really leaves me at a loss, and lately I've just been trying to avoid her as much as possible.

First off, let me admit that I do not know first-hand anything about depression. I know that you can't control it, I know that people train themselves to hide it, and I know that it is unbearable. But to be honest, I do not know what it actually feels like. Sure I've felt sad in my life, but I've never felt so hopeless that I seriously consider taking my own life. So please, before you throw negative comments my way, understand that I don't understand. 

That being said, the little things I do know about depression/suicidal thoughts I only know because my best friend has suffered from this illness since as long as he can remember. He is nearly 30, so for me it has been 10 years of knowing and trying to empathize with his sickness, and 10 years of trying to help him. That brings me to the reason I am here, the reason I need a little insight or perspective. 

I can't take it anymore. I can't take the periods of joy and optimism that are always cut short by negative, suicidal thoughts. I can't take thinking that if he doesn't pass this class, or that girl rejects him, I'm going to receive a call the next day from his mom saying that he finally did it. It's taking a toll on me; I can't sleep, I can't focus. I care about him dearly, so when he says things like ""I'm giving myself until next year"" it hurts like hell. I can't keep thinking that if a month goes by and I don't see him, something will happen.
He has tried to get better. He is seeing a therapist and is even on medication, but the happiness never lasts. There is nothing more I can say to him that I haven't said a thousand times. I keep encouraging him to take a trip to get out of this environment, and he starts off excited but it never happens. I try to get him to join clubs, be more social, but I'm always stopped with a thousand excuses.
Sometimes I think that knows what to say to get me to say "" I love you, you're worth it, you're great..etc"". Sometimes I think he is exaggerating for attention. Every year is the same. He threatens to kill himself, and we come running. Nothing happens, he feels great, he goes back. We always drop everything and come running.
I'm just so tired of the drama. Tired of letting him poke jabs at me and me keeping my mouth shut because I don't want to playfully tease him for fear that he will take it seriously. Tired of reassuring him that he's great, he's worth it, he's valuable. 
Sometime I feel like a shitty friend for thinking these things, other times I feel angry at him (though I've never said it). 
Sometimes I just want to let him go, for my sake. I can't be someone's crutch, and I can't continue to let that much negative energy in my life. 
I don't know how to help him. It hurts my heart because he is a dear friend and I care immensely about him, I just don't know how to be there without feeling complete sadness around him. I know it's selfish, believe me. I just don't know where to go from here.

I regularly go to psychotherapy as well as taking venlafaxine (Effexor XR 150mg). Venlafaxine allowed me to keep going and get things done. However, during the last few months I increasingly find myself in states of pathological longing or some kind of mania.

To give you a few examples what I mean:
When I see an attractive girl somewhere, I immediately feel the need to meet her and have a relationship/sex with her. I imagine it. I can't think of anything else, but I feel shattered by my own reason holding me back from even approaching her. Sometimes it's so painful to realize this inability that I just feel the need to kill myself.
Also, I have a girlfriend and I love her, so that makes these other feelings and needs even more painful. I love to have sex with her but I can't reach a physical orgasm during sex since I'm taking the medication.

I feel the urge to go insane. I really long for hedonism. If I could, I would shoot up heroine and just decay in a warm embryonic state of bliss. I think about taking DMT and experiencing fantasy worlds every day. Then there's this strong voice of reason always pulling myself away from doing this. The act of getting pulled back into the sound condition of sober thoughts is so painful that I want to kill myself.
I want to get lost and rise into ecstatic worlds of near-death consciousness.

When back in sober thoughts, I feel utterly depressed, laying awake at night, emptily gazing into darkness.

My parents divorced around the same time. I'm a 21 yr old female. I have a history of drug/alcohol abuse. I'm also smart, lively, healthy, and talented but depression is taking too much from me.  
Lately, the past 8 months or so, my depression has taken off to the point where I am literally and figuratively afraid for my life. I feel like I'm stuck in mud in a tunnel, and I'm confused and can't get out because everything is DARK. Another way I can describe this is that I'm walking around with my head cut off. In a fog.  
I spend a lot of time alone, on the internet. I've drifted a bit from close friends. Most of my social life revolves around meeting guys and drinking. It's fun but shallow.  
I can't figure out where all this anguish and pain is coming from. I can't figure out how to make it go away. I've tried anti depressants and they kind of work, but I dislike the side effects (can't orgasm on them, quite frankly).  
So my question is what steps should/could I take? The healthcare system is a fucking nightmare, getting an appointment with a psychiatrist is like a 3 month affair. There are times I have considered walking into the ER and telling them I want to kill myself. But that has ramifications and I have a job so I can't be held at the hospital.

I don't know where else to submit this and if it is the wrong place please point me in the direction of the right place.

I've known pretty much all my life I was different to most other people. I've always had difficulty making and keeping friendships. Most kids didn't really want to be my friend. They didn't really bully me, they just didn't want anything to do with me. I never really knew how to talk to them either, and when I did they weren't interested.

I'm pretty sure I have adjustment disorder. I have never been to see a psychologist, I know I need to but for some reason I can't. I feel like I'm trapped in my own mind and I don't know what's real anymore. I see so often things out of the corner of my eye, I think there's a cat there but when I turn to look there's nothing (Edit: This happens a lot, far more than normal). I have trouble sleeping, it takes me about 2-3 hours to get to sleep no matter how tired I am.

What prompted me to write this: I am at tertiary education, in my class there are mostly females (myself included), I made friends with a couple then not long before term holidays I thought they were starting to distance themselves from me, I thought they were starting to realise that something's wrong with me (this happens a lot as has always happened, people get to know me then when they start to suspect something's wrong they leave me). They didn't talk to me during the term holidays (about 2 weeks) then when term started again they were distant towards me. I figured fuck it, this happens all the time and if they don't want to talk to me I won't talk to them. I was also quiet towards everyone because I was extremely upset.

It didn't take long for the other classmembers to notice. One of them asked me that day if something was wrong, I said I was just tired. She was pretty much the only person to ask. The two girls I thought were my friends ignored me and didn't check to see if I was ok. Eventually I told a couple of people what was going on.

But now I think I made a mistake. That I was just imaging them being distant, and that now I've made a big deal about nothing and I feel embarrassed because I think it was just my brain fucking with me and now everyone is going to know something's wrong with me.

It's like I'm contaminated and I have to ruin everything by being so fucking crazy. I can't trust what I see and I constantly think people can't be trusted. That if I tell them something they'll have a part of me and will use it against me or tell everyone what I've told them and then no one will want to know me because they'll know I'm fucked up.

If I am under the slightest amount of stress I go crazy and make stupid decisions. I can't handle it. I hate not being able to trust myself because I don't know if my reaction is ""me"" or the adjustment disorder or whatever I have that's ruining my life.

I want to drop out of tertiary education but I have this image of what I want my future to be like and if I drop out that future won't happen. I can't let my adjustment disorder win.

But I also can't see a psychologist. It won't let me. I don't know why I just can't bring myself to do it. I actually did go in and ask (there's a counseller there) and the chick gave me her email address, but it's been months and I haven't done it.

It all sounds so petty, worrying about friends when there's more important issues, but that's just the most recent example of my craziness and aside from adjustment disorder (although a lot of things I experience can't be chalked up to that) I don't know what's wrong.

I read that adjustment disorder can lead to schitzophrenia, anti-social personality disorder and depression. So I read up about them ages ago and I didn't really have much in common with them then, but earlier I read up about schitzophrenia and I have a lot in common with it now - but I think that a lot of people could say that, and only a psychologist who talks to me can tell me for sure.

When I was 12 I wanted to be a sniper. Before that I wanted to be a spy or an assassin because I didn't know the word for what I wanted to be was a sniper. I liked the idea of being on the outside looking in and I could kill these people and they wouldn't know until they were already dead. I liked the control I would have over the situation.

In middle school me and a friend would make up stories and I would get really into it and act like it was real. She told me later that the other kids told her not to be friends with me. I later left her because she was distancing herself from me and becoming closer friends with this other chick. I would also get to school early and would wait in class bored. So I would (because I was obsessed with Asterix and Obelix) recite the script to a couple of the movies out loud. While there was other people around.

I also really don't want to be here. I often wish I could just disappear. I really wish I could go away someplace and never have to worry about anything again. I honestly think I'm just a fucking failure and I will never amount to anything.

Please help me figure out what's wrong with me so I can stop acting like a crazy person.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Something is wrong with me and I feel like I'm going crazy

For so long I've been trying to be a better person. I'm not a horrible scumbag or anything, most people would probably tell you I'm a nice guy. But honestly, if I acted out how I felt in my heart, I'd be the biggest asshole around. Because deep down, it feels like I really don't give a shit about anything, or anyone. It's like I have removed the notion of emotion from all my relationships with people. 

By default, I look at everything with pure logic, which is destructive to relationships. It's all just an act, none of what I do for my friends comes from the heart. Most of the time, I try to stop being so insensitive and ignore the logistics. I try my best to be a good person, but something inside me just eats away at me every time I feign my love/gratitude. It's like there's a voice in the back of my head saying ""I can't believe you're falling for this bullshit. They're using you."" 

What's worse is what happens when there's some type of mishap/problem with my friends. My brain goes full sociopath, and suddenly I question everyone's motives, and start to distance myself from everyone. Then after being alone for a few days or so, I just kind of break down. For a bit I lose hope, I tell myself that this is all I will ever be, all my efforts are in vain, and I should just stop trying, and embrace the lifestyle of a piece of shit person. I get really mad, to the point where my blood feels like magma flowing through my veins. I start destroying things, punching walls, I can't describe the anger. I'm not angry at my friends, but at myself. They aren't perfect, but no one is. They try, they reach out. I should do the same. But no matter how hard I try, it never makes it to the real world. The more time you spend around me, the more apparent it is that I don't give a shit. I can't even say ""sorry"" without it sounding like my mom forced me to say it, it's pathetic. I always try to stay positive, because in the end this is all I have. But everyday it just gets harder and harder, and I get angrier and angrier during my episodes. It feels like I have 10% of a heart, if that makes sense. I don't care very much, but I care just enough to care about not caring. Because I know the people around me deserve better than my current self. 

This all might be a little easier if I had someone to talk to. I have never really connected or opened up to anyone, ever. I've had a few ""significant others"" for lack of a better term, but they were a series of meaningless encounters with girls who are just like me, dead inside. Something about a women who has given up on it all is attractive to me. But even then, it's very easy to walk away/be walked away from. I guess sometimes it's nice to go through the motions, just to feel normal.

More than anything I wish I could somehow tell everyone that I am trying. I'm trying so hard. I've been trying for a long time, and I will always try, at the very least. 

Can anyone offer any type of guidance? Does anyone else feel this way? Someone throw me something, anything

I don't know what to do anymore.  I love my work and I put every bit of effort and caring I have into it, and it is still apparently not good enough.  On top of this I'm attempting to write a dissertation that's due a year from now, and dealing with an abusive advisor who, I'm realizing, is more concerned about the (excessive, unpaid) work I do as an assistant than about actually advising me. A year from now I'm graduating, if I don't drop out before then, and my only options at this point seem to be moving back in with my parents (an environment in which I feel I would be physically unsafe) and being homeless, as I've long since given up on the job market.  Living with roommates probably won't be a long-term option, as all my friends are getting partnered/married and I'm far too ugly and socially awkward to think that's a possibility for me, and I can't afford to live on my own.

I'm at work for 12 hours or more most days, and by the time I get home, I'm so exhausted that I fall asleep on top of my laptop or doing other work. Despite this, everyone around me, including my supposed friends, still treats me as if I'm useless scum if I forget to do something or miss an e-mail.  I feel as if I have to constantly be vigilant when it comes to justifying my existence, while everyone else around me gets a free pass no matter what they do.  I'm still getting shit for the stuff I failed to get done 5-6 months ago (when I was essentially living out of my car on top of working 80 hours a week, and was living in a place with no Internet so I couldn't respond to work e-mails in my off time).

I'm too old (30) to look for work in another field, as if I had the time to devote to getting the training given my current schedule.  I'm running out of options and I'm too exhausted and overwhelmed to do anything about it.  I'm seeing a therapist, but this has been of limited help, as I either seem to get ""reassurance"" that it's all in my head or suggestions that I just need to get back on the meds that weren't helping me anyway.
I'm still at work; I want to just go hide somewhere and do something self-destructive (used to be a cutter but I haven't done this in almost 8 years).  I have no one to talk to who isn't already exhausted by my ""drama"" and so I'm resorting to posting anonymously on an Internet board.  I want to be done with this.  I don't see any purpose for myself in life anymore, yet I don't have the courage to go through with suicide because there are still things I enjoy (although I feel guilty and selfish for even being here and enjoying these things).  I doubt anyone would care beyond the fact that I inconvenienced them by not being able to follow through on whatever I committed to. 

Please don't tell me I'm better than this/good enough/etc., as all my life experience up to this point and my dealings with other people are evidence to the contrary.  Please don't tell me that things will get better, because from here they can only get worse.

A couple times now, at moments when I read or experience something distressing, the most bizarre thing starts happening...exaggerated, illogical thoughts enter my head and then suddenly there's this intense spiraling downwards and I feel as if I'm going insane. Like...I literally feel as though I'm about to become unhinged. Snap, run on all fours, the whole shebang. My sense of self falling away at a terrifying rate. And I usually manage to pull myself back or it'll pass in about 15 seconds altogether...but the feeling is the most unsettling thing I've ever experienced.

I am very afraid of going insane. And this would not be the first time that I focused so intently on a fear that I started ""making"" it come true in my head.

But this feels so strange, and so scary. My grandmother is deeply schizophrenic, but my family believes it's because her birth was days long and very physically traumatic for both baby and mother, and her symptoms have been lifelong. I don't know if that can even cause schizophrenia.

I have been under a very intense amount of stress for the last ten months. Stress of pretty much every variety, to the point where sometimes I can't eat more than a snack a day because my stomach is so knotted from stress.

What is happening to me? I'm scared. I don't want to lose everything. Is this just a different kind of panic attack maybe?

Wednesday, I had vertigo and collapsed upon returning home. Today, yesterday, and most of the day before, I've felt like every muscle in my body is tearing apart. I'm exhausted and I can't focus. I've been taking my medication, except for the handful of days I had to do without, because I couldn't afford to refill it. I've stopped going to therapy. The three therapists I've had in the past four months have helped me make no progress and I'm not interested in wasting my time and digging myself deeper into debt for someone who can't help me. 

I finally cracked and let my friends know what was going on. But, I still don't trust anyone enough to truly confide in them. The best I've been able to do is bleed my heart out to random strangers, in hopes someone will answer. My anxiety and depression aren't the worst they've ever been, but I'm at the point where I have no interest in life. I'm tired, bored, and grieving. Tired of hurting. Bored of life. Grieving for what I can't have. To love and be loved. 

I've been diagnosed as Borderline. I have traits of avoidant, dependent, and narcissistic. My depression is referred to as ""Dysthmic"", because of it's ""moderate"" expression and my consistent level of anxiety. Post Traumatic Stress and Obsessive Compulsive. Somatization Disorder, as well. 

Altogether, I guess I'm ""high functioning"" for a mentally ill twenty year old male. Or at least, that's what people get out of me. It takes everything I have to appear high functioning. To not look weak. To not be prey for someone who would hurt me. To not be a target. To not be a victim. I can ""function"" in short bursts. I can go to college or out with some friends and have a breakdown. For all intents and purposes, sometimes I look fine. 

I've been hospitalized six times in the past two years. Two suicide attempts, multiple suicide plans and periods of suicidal ideation. I can't hold a job down, because the anxiety, stress, paranoia, and somatization eventually drive me into a breakdown. I've quit, been let go, been fired, or just ***left***. 

Three months into college and my body starting failing me. The tremors came back. The spasms and the convulsions. The headaches. The muscle and nerve pain. The fatigue and the weakness. The exhaustion. The dizzyness, the lightneadedness. The vertigo. The nausea and the paranoia. 

I'm afraid of losing my mind, again. I'm afraid of going crazy. I'm afraid of becoming more insane. Sometimes, though, I think I'm perfectly sane. There's a little voice in the back of my head that tells me I'm full of shit. That I'm just weak. A coward. A failure. A loser. Not willing to be a man and face my life. Instead, I always run away or crack under the pressure. I'm not ill, I'm just weak and stupid. The worst part, is that I'm not entirely convinced that voice is wrong. 

I can feel myself slipping. I know the stress, anxiety, and pressure of... just living is too much for me, right now. I'm not even doing anything insane. I go to community college, I do my work, I hang out with my friends. I work as a temp, for Christ's sake. The only ""emotional"" stressor in my life is the fact my girlfriend left me. Over five months ago. My life is good right now, but I'm still breaking apart. It doesn't make any sense to me. I take my medication, I've been trying with therapy, and nothing is situationally wrong with my life.

I feel like no one takes me seriously, when I actually tell the truth about how I feel. I'm intelligent, far more so than the average person. I'm marginally attractive, or so people have been telling me, lately. I have good friends. On top of the fact that I appear high functioning and have no real problems, right now. Which, you know, I get. I understand how I'm not as much of a priority as someone dealing with drug addiction or self harm. I've always been ""too smart"" for that. I've always known the consequences wouldn't be worth the temporary relief. 

I just wallow in my own misery. Suppress it. Repress it. Bottle it up. Until my brain short-circuits. My nervous system is deep fried. My brain is cross-wired. Because, I swallowed my pain and choked on this Hell. I guess I'm one of those people who can't be broken, completely. I'll just spend the rest of my life at the precipice of ""half-insane"". I'm just too strong to be pushed off the edge. But, not strong enough to move away. Maybe, I'm just weak. Too afraid to do what needs to be done. Too stupid to see what's real. It's not like my entire perception of reality has been completely and utterly proven false multiple times in the past few years. ***Oh.*** 

I lock myself away. In my house. In my room. No one can see my spasm or convulse. No one can see me fail to cry, because the tears that I so desperately need just won't come. No one can see my bloodshot, dilated eyes and unkempt appearance after three days of barely eating, not showering, and sleeping in excess. No one can see my paranoia. My constant inner conflict. No one can see me argue with myself, every second of every day. No one can see the fatigue and exhaustion my empathy has undergone from giving *so much* of myself when I have nothing left to give. No one can see me going through the motions and emulating what my fractured memory says is what I'm suppose to do in situations. No one can see the years of my life completely erased from my memory. No one can see me **fail** *elementary-school math* when I'm my left eye is so sensitive to every visual sensation I have to slam my palm against my face to ease the pressure from the swelling in my brain and not rip the damn thing out of its socket. No one can see the despair and turmoil I'm in, because I'm so deeply **ashamed** of myself that even *thinking* of the things that cause me so much pain is too much for my anxiety. 

No one can see my suffering, because I've spent twenty years learning to hide it. To suppress it. To repress it. To deny it. To hide from it. To act like nothing is wrong. To act like a fucking jackass to hide the fact I'm dead inside. No one can see my suffering make a victim out of me. No one can hurt me, anymore. But, no one can help me, either. No one can help me help myself. 

The worst part, is that my heart is growing colder, darker. My mind is melting. My body is breaking apart, piece by piece. I swear on the soul I don't have, it's just pathetic. The only place I feel safe enough to be honest about myself is in total anonymity, where no one will respond or reach out to me. It'll just go unremarked upon and I don't blame anyone. I'm so much of a nervous wreck I can't read anyone else's shit without triggering myself and spazzing out in paranoia. So, whatever.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Is it safe to let this out?

We were going to form an Active Minds chapter together, but after teaming up with another student, they ditched me. Throughout our friendship, she would constantly tell me not to open my mouth about mental health issues because I ""did not know what I was talking about,"" ""shouldn't express my opinions on those issues,"" and ""don't have the same perspective as everyone else."" Examples include gun control. I'm from western Long Island, where no one really has a gun. I'm in support of gun access, but I believe a more in-depth mental health analysis should be done before letting people have a licensed gun (are they living with people who are severely mentally unstable?) and gun usage courses should be mandatory. But, since I ""live in a bubble and have an anxiety problem,"" my opinion is invalid. Another example is when I brought up the fact that some people in prison need better mental healthcare during their stay- once again, ""invalid due to my condition."" In general, she's also made comments such as ""this isn't an issue that's actually a problem- you're just over reacting"" when discussing politics. Overall, she's very closed minded and not respectful of my opinions due to my anxiety.

We have no mental health groups on campus besides the counseling center, and because a policy prevents 2 similar clubs from existing, I can't form one. So, I'm made to feel like I can't be a mental health advocate on campus because I suffer from mental health problems myself.

She keeps talking nonsense about how things are 'self evident' and other things that just don't make sense. I'm wary of labelling and trying to diagnose her, but whatever is happening to her seems like symptoms of schizophrenia. Whatever it is, she's just not herself anymore. It's like I see glimpses of who she is but the rest of the time, when she's talking about this stuff, she's a different person. She's not sleeping well, and her behaviour is becoming stranger and stranger. She keeps attaching various abstract meanings to objects that in themselves don't make sense. I'm worried that the behaviour will lead to her hurting herself, not self harm, but something like accidentally pouring hot coffee on herself. What's worse is that she's in the middle of her university exams. 

I don't know what to do. At this point I don't think anything I say to her can change her mind from these delusions. I've read that symptoms of schizophrenia must be present for 6 months to be diagnosed properly, but she needs help now or else she'll start to mess things up. I tested the waters, asking if she'd be willing to go to a doctor, and she responded with a flat out no, so I left it. Now her mum has realised something is wrong with her (she's been like this for about 5 days now, and getting worse) so she's going to ask me about it, I don't know what to tell her but I feel like if I'm honest then she might take her to the doctor, which would probably be best. If not, when is the right time to take the next step? And what the hell would that be? We live in the UK if that helps.

He's currently in University studying Mathematics and is ecstatic about the material. I've also known him for more than 15 years.


He's always been what I would call a ""pathological liar"", as in he makes up all sorts of outlandish stories about things that happened to him that are clearly fictional. 


Last August, he apparently got extremely inebriated and made a complete fool of himself during Frosh week and burned a lot of bridges. He apparently got into a lot of fights, abused this one girl (not sexually), and a whole bunch of other weird stuff that I won't get into. 


He claims that he has PTSD and is seeing a councillor. He cannot stop reliving the experiences and is always remembering new and outlandish events that happened to him.


All this time I had thought that he was making up stories but I think he is actually fabricating memories. The more he thinks about it, the more crazy stories he remembers.


I got into the habit of ignoring most of what he said because I knew it was all garbage. His mental state has been deteriorating recently and one of the major things that made me really change my tune about all this is that he is now fabricating memories about me, and things that I did, and things that I saw him do. Things that I am 100% sure NEVER ever happened. 


He is a virgin, and has recently ""remembered"" losing his virginity 6 months ago on a night that we were together at a bar. The same night he claims to have gotten into 11 bar fights. All of which I witnessed, and apparently a mutual friend of ours too. I know this never happened, and our mutual friend has confirmed that this never happened.


He is becoming extremely frustrated with me, yelling at me on the phone telling me that he KNOWS I did certain things. He'll also call me and thank me for doing him some huge favour, telling me that I'm a great friend, even though no such favours ever occurred. 


These past few days have been especially bad and I'm starting to seriously reconsider my options. I've been contacting all of his friends and all of our mutual friends trying to gather consensus on certain events.

I've been taking Zoloft everyday in the morning since September of last year. Even though I'm better in almost all mental aspects since I start taking it, I feel like everyday it doesn't really work or ""kick in"" until much later in the day, like 7 or 8 hours after I've taken it. Until that point, I feel completely lethargic, I'm not really able to concentrate, and I have a bad headache. I just have a mental fog.

These feelings are different, but similar, than before when I wasn't on an SSRI. I don't experience a lot of my previous depressive symptoms or at least not as much before starting treatment. However, when it does reach that point in the day, I feel a tremendous difference. My concentration improves dramatically and I have a lot more mental energy. I don't feel like I have a headache as much.

Could my feelings be due to the concentration of the drug not reaching its peak? Depending on which source you look at (such as http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1806626 or http://www.ems1.com/ems-products/education/articles/486173-Sertraline-Zoloft-Drug-Whys/ for example), they estimate that peak concentration is reached between 4.5 to 8.5 hrs. Perhaps, another possibility: I'm not on a strong enough dosage? I only take 50 mg currently. I'm only speculating, but the drug could be at a much lower strength within my system by the next dosage when I take it the following day.

Does anyone experience anything similar to what I'm feeling on a daily basis with their SSRI? Do you know if this is a known feeling to occur with people on SSRI's or if you know someone who experiences something similar to me?

It started a long time ago - I had a rather dark childhood and it took me over a decade to tell anyone about it... But once I did I started getting better. The suicidal thoughts weaned and a desire to live and enjoy everything life had to offer started to come back. I felt safer, and I had an amazing boyfriend who knew everything about my past and still loved me. But then we went away for school across the province and our relationship started to struggle, and I could feel the depression coming back. I needed him more than he was prepared to be there for me, and we called it quits. I hit crisis mode and did a number of things I regret, and now he is never going to forgive me or come back into my life. That idea alone is making it hard for me to function in every day life without spontaneously bursting into tears.

Along with that, a lot of family issues have come up recently and I started to have just really strained relationships with everyone I love. 

The other day, I admit to my parents that I think I'm depressed and that I've thought about numerous possible ways to die (although I haven't acted on a single one of them, nor formed a plan, etc.). They were really supportive, but they don't quite understand. Still, they're making an effort to make me happy, and it means so much more than they can even begin to understand.

I want to get better, but I don't know how. I became so dependent on my boyfriend for emotional support that now that he's not in the picture, I'm being overwhelmed by these thoughts of not wanting to live anymore. I loved him more than my family (which I regret now...) and call me crazy (because I am) but I had imagined having a future with him and whatever. I never thought I would lose him and sometimes during my hardest days just the thought of being able to see him or talk to him would be the only thing that kept me going. 

Now, I feel like... I'm going to be forever alone, so what's the point of living without him, and with all of these thoughts and my past haunting me every day...?

After telling my parents I now know that killing myself would hurt everyone I love, and that alone helps keep the thoughts to just my mind. 

But it's so hard and it's absolutely exhausting. I tried seeing a counselor when I was in first year about my mental health problems (at my university) but she was awful and completely shut me down...  Said I was only having a hard time because everyone has a hard time adjusting in first year, and that I would get better, etc.

I guess I just really needed to rant about all of this to someone who I don't know, so I turned to you, reddit. Seeing a therapist or psychiatrist isn't ideal for me, but have I run out of options? I don't know how much more fight I have left in me... and I just need some advice from anyone who might have a similar story.

I don't know what led to it, why, or for how long. So I know her current state can't be explained purely by her age (84), but the escalation could be a sign of the early stages of dementia. I don't really know though, and that's partially why I'm here looking for advice. She is from a very small town in southern Mississippi, where she and my grandfather were very active in local politics. They were vocal against racism and my grandfather was active in the civil rights era. My grandfather would even go as far as driving black men and women to the polls to vote. This fueled some dislike directed at them by white local politicians and business owners. In 1985, two years before I was born, my bipolar grandfather committed suicide after entering a very bad business deal and losing almost all their money. He was at one point also committed before, roughly at the same time she was. She continued to live there by herself until my birth after my parents convinced her to move closer to us. A few years ago I moved in with her because of her mental health.

Here's her current state:  It's really hard for even me to understand her delusions, but I'll try to explain them as best I can.

She believes there were individuals that conspired to spread lies about her and my grandfather. She won't or can't explain why she believes this and becomes hostile if I press for an explanation. The lies basically center around her being a 'slut' and being involved in a prostitution ring. She claims that 'they' were the reason she was committed, and that while committed her doctor raped her. My grandfather's commitment at nearly the same time only fueled her belief that it was 'them' that had them committed. She believes my grandfather's suicide and the bad business deal that led to it was caused by 'them'.

'They' took out newspaper ads to subtly attack them by using specific words or phrases in the ad. This has currently extended to television. She currently believes Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews are either in on it or are reading scripts written by the shadowy 'them'. I'm in on it too apparently, she has accused me of using 'tweeter' to talk about her personal life on the internet, and because of this they know details of her life they shouldn't be aware of. She's never used a computer in her life, so I assume she only knows about Twitter from it being mentioned on 24 hour news networks. These accusations hurt just as much as they are unfounded.

She claims to encounter people in public from her hometown, over 400 miles away, that would have to be either dead or elderly by now. These people follow her occasionally. These people have also recruited others into their systematic and unending harassment of her. It's gotten to the point where every time she leaves the house she returns upset because some individual she encountered has harassed her or tried to play mind games with her. And again she either won't or can't explain to me how or why they are doing it and becomes hostile and angry if I ask for an explanation.

Example: Last month we had severe flash flooding, and we have a tiny creek that separates our property from our neighbors. Homes downstream were flooded and our city decided to dig the creek deeper to prevent future flooding. On our property there is considerable vegetation that would make it difficult to move heavy machinery through, so the city initially asked or neighbors if they could move machinery through their property to reach the creek. They refused. So the city approached us to gain permission to cut down trees and use our property for access. She agreed, and initially thought nothing of the city's request. But the next day she was upset because the situation was planned by 'them' to harass her. I don't know if 'they' are our neighbors, the city engineer that stopped by, or the rain storm.

It's turned into arguments now. I've tried talking about this stuff with her to better understand what's going on in her mind, but that didn't work. I've tired to get her to look at what she thinks is being done to her rationally but that doesn't work. I've been patient and have tried to convince her to speak with someone, even if she believes the experience wouldn't change her views. Watching her spiral down like this is killing me. She's in so much pain over something that doesn't exist and there isn't a thing I can do myself to help her. She needs professional help, but won't even consider it because 'I just don't understand what's happening but she does.'

I'm willing to do anything at this point, but I'd prefer avoiding forced commitment or a nursing home. That's my last option. What can I do? Could I approach her GP without my grandmother's knowledge? Is there anything the GP could do to help her? Are there any public services that I could get in contact with to help her? 

This is stressing me out so badly that it's beginning to affect my career and personal life. I feel like I've put my life on hold to help her, but I won't abandon her either.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,How can I convince my paranoid and delusional grandmother to seek help?

A good friend of mine is currently hospitalized for a mental disorder for some kind.  The Drs aren't saying anything but the treatment seems to be similar to treating for schizophrenia.

This friend of mine is quite a bit younger than me, and while we are not close he is a very valued friend.  We met going through school and we were roomates after my husband made life so miserable I had to leave.

Recently he had some physical health issues that changed his life plans, but he seemed to be coping very well.  Then we had this FB conversation that was really really weird.  He was talking about himself in the 3rd person, jumping all over the place, inserting things that weren't part of the conversation.

Then his ex boyfriend contacts me and lets me know stuff had really went south.  He had started talking about conspiracies, and that Trudeau was going to need him for an uprising.  Writing notes and stashing them places.

Fast forward to now.  he is getting help and he was home for the weekend this weekend.  I called him.  It was great to talk to him and he was very positive.  But he still wasn't quite himself.  I would say almost manic.

My question to all, esp from people who have been on the other side.  Do I mention anything about how concerned I was?  He seems to be enjoying the hospital but doesn't seem to believe anything is really wrong with him.  Do I just go along with what he says?  Do I try to keep him grounded?  I really want to be there for him, but its scary for me as well.  Before he was one of the most grounded logical people I have ever met.  That was what we connected over were great conversations.  I want to make sure I don't make things worse, or make him feel bad.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Seeking help relating to a friend who has been having difficulties.

What do these symptoms code for as in a mental disease?

Aspergers.
Talking to one self in vivid, and insulting voices, to the point when the person slaps himself in the face due to the same persons voice orders,
general sadness,
 and lack of emotions towards other people in general. 
Not hate, just lack of feelings toward friends or other people, however, feeling appreciation and love for family.
excessive focus on one area, usually shifting from 1 to the other through ""periods"".

lack of enjoyment for parties, social activities, but can interact with people reguarly.

Lack of ability to understand social language, or no knowing when to shut up, arguing that the individual is right.
self hatred, usually puts himself aside in front of family, angering them when he puts them before he does.

""grown up language"" when little and praised for intelligence , eventually called immature and ""having child like attitudes"" on late teens by family, from 14 all the way to 18. (parents said videogames destroyed my logic, I am logcally damaged due to games, they blame EVERYTHING on games, and they NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER saw any of the sings of aspergers disease, I had to figure that out for myself, everything fits.)
spoke 2 languages when 3 years old, can remember almost an entire movie I watched many times up to 3 to 4 years ago, but cant remember birthdays, or important things. 
lack of ability to make friends.
prefers being alone.
random ""shake attacks"" when the body´s right or left arm shake uncontrollably for a couple of seconds, then redurn to normal. Also happen with entire back, random sahcking for 2 seconds, then return to normal
they tell me I often disrespect them, (without curse words) but most of the time I dont know how or why is that an insult.

Whatever she is experiencing paired with whatever drugs they're prescribing make her extremely nervous, awkward, prone to random 3-second crying fits, and easily confused.  Add to that, horrifically low self esteem.  She has zero concept of social appropriateness these days and every time I meet with her in public I have to be armed and ready with subject changes or de-escalation techniques.  Normal people do not have to teach themselves de-escalation techniques just to have lunch with their mother.

I only see her once every few weeks because she exhausts me.  I am not equipped to deal with her and I think she needs to be admitted somewhere until they can figure out what is actually wrong and how to deal with her.  She calls me on occasion, but I'm not an open person and do not have ANY desire to share details of my life.  She exhausts me by always wanting to know what I'm doing.  She just wants somebody to talk to her and as her daughter I am target #1, but she doesn't seem to have any idea how invaded I feel when she calls.  I can't talk to her like a normal mother or get advice from her, so I see no reason to share many details of my life with her.  She will just tell other people my business anyway and get the details wrong.  Already had my SIL call me in a panic wanting to know if I was ok after being crashed into and shot at.  It was a fender-bender, not a gang shoot-out!!!

My dad just kind of lets her do what she wants and just takes her places where she's least likely to act out. To my knowledge he has not pushed her to see a therapist, which I firmly believe she desperately needs.  He believes people should keep their problems to themselves, I guess.

Every time we eat, or get dressed, or exercise, he comments on how ""fat"" he is, and doesn't listen to me at all when I tell him how great he looks.

A few years ago, he started working out seriously, and lost a bunch of weight (and looked great), but it has turned into a bit of an obsession and now he worries both about being too fat AND about not being big/muscular enough. But I'd say the feeling fat worry is still the major one. He is so sensitive about it that he cannot stand it if I touch him anywhere near his stomach. (Here I should probably clarify that, while this problem clearly causes him some level of anxiety on probably a daily basis, it is not so severe that it would prevent him from functioning normally or being successful....it's just really frustrating for both of us.)

Anyways, I have said and done everything I can think of to make him feel better about his body, and by now I think he has just trained himself to not listen to any of it, so nothing I say seems to make any difference. This is why I think he may need to talk to a professional.

I have been dealing with depression for the last 6-7 years (I'm 24). It waxes and wanes from feeling pretty ok to locking myself in my room for days at a time and being completely unable to deal with the world. For most of this time I have been self medicating with drugs and alcohol. I got out of the hard drug hellhole three years ago and since then it's been weed and alcohol. For about the last year the ""cycle"" has stopped and I feel like i've been barely keeping it at bay with a 6-pack and two bowls a day. I'm about to graduate (finally) and begin working and then law school. So two weeks ago, determined to better myself and enter the next stage of my life I quit drinking and smoking, both for health reasons and because I need clean pee. Since then my world has come crashing down and It's time to get help. Here's the issue.

I own, collect, and compete with firearms. I shoot most weekends, hand-load my own ammunition, build my own rifles, have a concealed carry permit, etc. and it's a great stress reliever for me. I'm afraid that If I go see a therapist or other mental health professional and they learn of my hobby they will immediately decide I am a danger to myself or others, which will very quickly lead to permanent loss of my firearm rights.

Just so we're clear. I have no desire or inclination to take my own life or hurt anyone, ever. That's not to say thoughts of suicide don't cross my mind but it's my opinion that suicide is the single most selfish act a human being can commit. I decided a long time ago that whatever pain I'm feeling isn't worth destroying the lives of the people who care about me.

At this point, I'm not really sure what my next step is. I want to get help, but in talking to a therapist it will be very hard to skirt the issue entirely and once the cat's out of the bag there's no putting it back.

It's a pretty great school, and my kids are all good kids (even the ones that aren't the ""best students"" and the ""trouble kids""). It's beautiful here and there's an interesting history to the place and the people. I get to see bowhead whales and polar bears. I get to see the northern lights. I'm getting a lot of great experience for my career and in life that many people will never have.

But, my god, is it lonely up here.

The population of our ~4-mile island (less than half of which is inhabited) is somewhere between 200 and 230, more than 95% is native, and while there are plenty of good people who are nice and polite, the ""community"" is quite exclusive, especially when it comes to ""white people"" (like, well, me and most of the rest of the school staff). I've been told to ""go back to where white people live"" and called ""racist"" numerous times, and though I try my damnedest to be sensitive of the culture, there is very little opportunity to educate myself about it locally. The locals seem pretty closed-mouthed about it.

The school staff isn't what I would call ""close"", either. The support staff and few veterans are at constant odds with the newbies (which is half the teaching staff) for whatever reasons (which they're equally closed-mouthed about), and our new principal is not a strong leader, so this situation is made worse seemingly by the day.

When I first arrived here last year, I noticed a lot of this, but given my workload and how much I enjoy doing what I do, I didn't think much of it. I basically just worked and was content with it, right up until the holidays when I returned briefly to the lower 48, my family, and my friends.

Over the holidays, I kind of lost it. Initially, it seemed like I'd forgotten how to be social, but that seemed to remedy itself pretty quickly. Sort of. I got really - REALLY - attached to my friends when I was around them, and made what I struggle to call ""embarrassing advances"" toward a couple of my close friends (including a very close ex-girlfriend of mine - yikes!). Much of this was later discussed and most cases brushed-off as ""yeah, we get it, life was awkward for you, whatever,"" but it's surely stayed in some of their minds since then. I couldn't say for sure. (With the ex - who'd since been one of my best friends in the world, really - things may have been completely screwed-up, as she seems quiet and avoidant, but thinking about that isn't going to help anything.) I had, for possibly the first times in my life, horrible panic attacks during this time, too, for reasons I can barely put a finger on. I didn't sleep, I barely ate, and I was constantly lethargic for almost a month straight (we had a long holiday break). Things returned to ""normal"" when I got back to the island, though, and started working again; I took a couple days to ""recover"", but was able to work as I normally did.

I made efforts to keep in touch with friends online after that. I figured it'd do me a lot of good, and I think it did, too. But that eventually waned; a few friends seemed to stop contacting me or responding frequently or at all (such as the aforementioned ex), and the Skype calls I'd made with a few of them were pretty short-lived (nobody has wanted to Skype with me for weeks, now). The four-hour time difference from almost everybody I knew before moving here certainly doesn't make it easy, I guess.

I'm sure my sentiments aren't unique. I moved somewhere and lost touch with people. That happens. But it's the combination of that, and where I am, now, that's making me go crazy.

There is pretty much nobody up here. Dating-wise, it's a bad idea to date locals; best-case scenario, I find someone ""eligible"", and wind up being hated by other locals for it, anyway (so I'm told, at least). I had a long-distance thing with somebody further south of me, and was hesitant to call it a ""relationship"" at the time because I didn't know if I'd be coming back (I hadn't been offered my contract yet, and wasn't likely to return to the state if that didn't happen); I have since been offered my position for the next school year, however, and have accepted.

School ends in less than two weeks. I will be in my hometown in less than three. At first, I was excited. Now...I don't know what I am.

First, I don't get the idea that I'll have much to go back home to. My family hasn't been in touch too well, and even when they are, they're constantly talking about how much great experience I'll have ""when [I] return to civilization"" and how much ""it'll help [me] get a job someplace else."" They make me feel like this is just some phase, or whatever, like a two-year camp I'm on before I can go tackle the ""real world"". They seem detached, and seem to be encouraging me to be detached, as well. The friends-not-contacting-me thing is a little concerning, too. There're a few I'd get to see, but...a very small handful, if their willingness to communicate with any frequency tells me anything.

I'm already feeling panicky again. I wouldn't say I've had ""attacks"" comparable to what I had over the holidays, but it seems to be building up to that. I'm not sleeping well, my appetite is diminishing, I'm feeling anxious for no readily-apparent reasons I can think of, and it's...well, scary.

For a few reasons.

One big one is, if this is how it got during the first year, what in heaven's name is the next year going to be like? My work load won't decrease (it's likely to increase, in fact), and while I'll certainly know more people here on the island, that doesn't seem to mean much.

What might I do to help myself stay sane? How might I stop myself from entering that hellish panic-mode again?

Help!

EDIT: I admit, I put this post up in a bit of a hurry. Panicky desperation, maybe? Anyhow, I thought I'd add some details, some perhaps not important, but nonetheless, here goes:

 - Weight loss/gain/loss. In the ~9 months before moving here, and a few months following, I lost about 60 lbs. I'd done this before, years ago, after high school (I lost about 75 back then), but it's since been more difficult. Some of the loss was due to loss of appetite during the holidays and the past week or so, and some of the gain was due to stress-eating. I'm trying my best to balance myself, here, and exercising/lifting seems to help me take my mind off of things, but fatigue from work and lack of sleep gets in the way of really being able to do that on a whim.

 - ""Comfort"" buying. I'm normally a pretty thrifty spender, and don't spend money on stuff except when it's for professional expenses (which I admit I *could* be much more frugal about) or the rare occasions to ""treat"" myself to something. I've been doing a lot more of the latter in the past month. Hundreds of dollars, actually, so I've cut myself off as of yesterday. I wouldn't say I'm greatly-unhappy about my purchases on the whole (that is, until I'll have to ship them away from here; it's all neat stuff, though, I guess), but I definitely didn't ""need"" much of it. I could have saved most - or all - of it to take a nice vacation this summer. I might still be able to, but...sigh.

 - Seeking ""what's comfortable"". I'm seeing something of a correlation between my general anxiety where I am right now and ""seeking out what's comfortable"" in general. In part, this might tie-in to the buying thing mentioned above, and in *bigger* part, it probably plays a bigger part in my over-attachment to my friends, as mentioned earlier in this post with regards to my behavior over the holidays. I am also very afraid that I have burned bridges from this, and have no real idea how to fix it, if it's even possible.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Isolation is driving me a little bit nuts.

I went to university straight out of school at 18 years old, studied for a year and failed my year resulting in me having to drop out and get a job. The failure hit me hard, largely because of the impact it had on my family, more specifically my parents. While working I started experiencing massive mood swings, for a few days I'd feel quite positive about my future and have everything in check in my mind, then as quickly as that feeling had come it would go and I'd feel so stressed about what was going on for the next few days and this would tend to cycle. I worked full time in a job that I really hated for a year, and then reapplied for university which is where I am now.

I never actually acknowledged to myself that this pattern was happening until recently when the changes seemed to be more emphatic, one night after a night out with some friends a few weeks back I got home and started listening to music and really crashed, I couldn't stop crying and thinking about how badly I had fucked things up and felt really awful, it was the lowest my mind-set had ever been. Since then, my low periods have been really low, I'm not really sure what suicidal thoughts are because I've often seen it as quite a nice way out for me but the knowledge of how it would impact other people in my life always overpower that feeling by a lot.

When I feel down I feel like I have to be alone, I'm extremely irritable with people but at the same time rational that I'm being like that so being alone almost feels like it's for their benefit. I feel extremely apathetic toward anything and everything, I have absolutely no sex drive and it's hard to maintain faux interest in anything which results in me shutting the majority of people out of my life. 

I don't really know what the point of this post is because I don't know what I can get out of it, I don't feel I can talk to anyone about this in reality, I've thought about getting professional help a number of times but always end up backing out.

I'm looking for advice on how to overcome my psychological problems and roadblocks. I've tried to summarize them below, and I'd be really grateful for any piece of advice you can offer - books, guidelines, personal experience, subreddits, other resources, whatever. Any input you can give is important to me. I know seeking professional psychiatric treatment would be the best course of action, but I just can't afford it right now.

So, most if not all of my problems stem from me comparing myself with others, inferring my worth from such comparisons, and my perfectionistic streak. Also, my problems are mostly about my interaction with other people, in other aspects of my life I'm doing okay.

I suspect these tendencies developed in my childhood - my parents always taught me to be the best, and I distinctly remember them saying that I should learn from other people's mistakes rather then making my own. I also never went to kindergarten, which I think set me back in my social skills somewhat. My social anxiety also became apparent pretty early - I can remember some of these problems manifesting at age 5-6. But I'm no psychiatrist, so I'm not going to try and over-analyze my childhood, this is just some background for you. I'm 24 now, and over the past year I've become more acceptive of myself, more forgiving for any imperfections, strong enough to try and change my life for the better.

**The problems and anxieties that I could identify in myself:**

* I always feel scrutinized, judged, like I have to perform well. Communication, work, appearance - I always feel like I have a standard to uphold.
* Consequently, I feel like most other people are able to judge me, I feel the need to defend against them. I can begin to feel uncomfortable even if the person in question is not in a position to judge me, has no ground to criticize me, and their criticism can't affect me anyway. So, this isn't linked to how much weight or consequence their criticism will hold, but more to their demeanor and behavior. Someone who looks stern or judging can make me uncomfortable - for example, someone at work who should be answering to me, but is sullen and uncommunicative, or a stern-looking woman in public transport who I don't even communicate with. In both of these examples the person can have basically no effect on my life, yet I felt nonplussed by them. This also happens with people whose opinion is important to me.
* I often feel like I'm on the defensive - I hold myself somewhat guarded, I use a lot of defensive expressions such as ""in my opinion"", ""I think so"", ""I guess"", ""probably"", and so on.
* I'm always comparing myself with other people, and I get really defensive and guarded in a conversation if there is someone in the group whom I automatically identify as superior in some important aspect (demeanor, masculinity, sense of humor, activity in the conversation, appearance).
* I'm very quiet in groups of people I don't know well. Most people that I know are able to get along easier in such situations. The more I stay quiet, the more anxious I get about being alienated from the group. The last two times I was in the company of lesser-known people someone commented on how quiet I am, which didn't help my self-esteem much.
    
**Some other things that bother me about myself:**

* Sometimes, if I see a person trying to achieve results that I can relate to (get a job in my field of expertise, get some rank in a video game I play) I automatically wish for them to fail, even if I harbor no bad feelings to that person. The reasoning behind this is that if they succeed, they'll be better than me in some ""comparison"", and I'm going to feel bad. I don't want to be like this and I feel like a dick, but these thoughts are automatic.
* Some days I feel small like a child, lost, and insignificant. At times like these it feels like everybody but me is confident and strong and knows what they are doing. I know it isn't so, but it just feels that way sometimes.
* Acceptance and other people's interest is very important to me. Sometimes I dwell on the thoughts that other people are way more popular, say the few friends that I have. It's true that I'm very much alone and mostly ignored by people, however I don't think that's anyone's fault but my own. Sometimes I go for days and weeks without talking to anybody outside of work. This brings me down often.

My best friend from college has a daughter who has been hearing voices. The young girl, who I called Carol, was told by her father it was probably tinnitus. Her mother, my friend from college and a registered nurse, said to me she did not believe her daughter was having psychotic episodes. This has been going on for about 2.5 years. Although they had allowed her to see a counselor in the past, because she was told the voices were tinnitus, she did not mention them to the doctor. At the time I wrote Carol was not under a doctor's care. Her parents were angry with me for my attempts to intercede on Carol's behalf and her mother was restricting my access to Carol and the family.

I still text with Carol online. She made me aware she had an appointment with a new Pediatrician this past Friday, because they were all on a new insurance plan. I let Carol know I thought it would be good to tell the Pediatrician about the voices, the suicidal thoughts, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This way she could get a referral to a psychiatrist or maybe some other help from the new doctor.

I saw Carol online early Saturday morning [like 2AM]. She let me know that the doctor told her a social worker was coming to the house to observe her. She didn't stay online long, so I don't know the particulars of what she said or how her parents reacted. In particular I do not know why the doctor wasn't able to refer Carol to a psychiatrist or a mental health clinic in the insurance network. I don't know if her parents are still be resistant to providing treatment or what. It sounds a little peculiar to me, but I don't want to pump Carol for details because I don't want her to feel like she has to ""take sides"" between her parents who are still angry with me, and my friendship with her as a separate person from her parents.

Can someone tell me whether it is common for a pediatrician to have a social worker come to the house to observe someone? I am quite relieved it is no longer just me who is taking Carol seriously, but I bet her parents are not happy having a stranger in the house. 

Thank you for your time and supportive advice in this.

Another thing is that I don’t want to lose what I consider my good traits while on the meds. I know CBT, either by itself or combined with medication is the most effective treatment, but I’m wanting to know **does anyone have any personal/professional experience with the pros and cons of these types of meds?

However, I did tell him a couple of problems I've been having lately regarding sleep, and how I'm part fixing them with melatonin. He knows I'm paranoid, and I have trouble sleeping.

He's so interested in me though. And it frustrates me, I hate people feeling sorry for me or trying to help me. Still, I didn't tell him all of my problems.

I'm probably crazy, I see and hear things sometimes, at other times more than some, but that could be sleep. I also have these weird thoughts that somone is following me, more like a feeling and I'm constantly checking around to make sure. I don't trust other people, and I'm a clean freak. I'm educated heavily in economics and physics, and that has basically made me a conspiracy theorist. Sometimes I'll be sitting there and basically forget English. Songs and talking are there but I can't quite understand them. The things I hear are normally not voices, like footsteps, phones ringing, bangs, car doors slamming and electronic beeps sometimes. The voices are kind of like a lot of the not understandable English, with one or two occasional sentences, phrases or words. One voice can become more sentient, once it was an Obama sounding person, and recently it was someone with a New York accent. By sentient, I mean I can talk to it and get responses briefly. Things I see are normally shadows and objects morphing, or moving. One thing that has recently stopped is me seeing things suddenly after it had already been there.

I actively go to the gym, or sit in my room to occasionally read, but I recently got a pull up bar, and for like a month straight I barely slept, heard less voices, did Pull ups/push ups/sit ups all the time on top of an hour and a half of actual workouts (chest, back.legs, etc).

But then the school counselor confronted me. Now my old craziness is back with an emphasis on voices and being shakey. I suddenly have no energy and always feel ridiculed, even when nothings talking. I feel like it's his fault, I was doing so well.

I remember exactly what they did, how they did it and it seriously messed me up for life. To not put too fine a point on it, this caused me to forget everything from my young life until the age of 8 (except that memory) so my first mental health issue was a severe case of PTSD, which later led to severe social paranoia and anxiety, but I digress.

At the age of 8, the sudden snap back to reality, came with it's own issues, namely guilt, I was blamed for what happened to me and many, many other things which led me to believe I was the central cause for all the bad things that happened ever (which is a very egotistical and destructive view to have) which led to the formation of a strange split in my head, there was the every day me, the one that got up, dressed, went to school, you know ""normal"" me, but this split developed and developed, and it was violent, emotionless and in my opinion deadly. I call it Guilt (capitalisation as a name) and it's been a constant and permanent fixture in my life since then. Now yes I can control this by locking it away, as it's not true DID, or any other form of multiple personality issue. It is a personality (and in my opinion wildly sociopathic if not psychopathic) but it doesn't really have the ability to simply take over when it wants. It's why I don't have a psychiatric condition in relation to it. Too difficult to diagnose/deal with something that can be controlled by have a stress-lite, organised life so no need to medicate or give therapy right?

Except I grossly under-represented the danger this thing possesses. When I say it's violent, I mean in a deadly way and it wants to be that way, and not only too me. When I say emotionless I literally mean just that, and it has no want to pretend to feel or show emotion, it's simply a machine of destructive desire, and the worst part. It COULD get control of me if I ever began to feel sufficiently guilty, or started to become disorganised, fall out of my routines. In fact for most of my teenage life this thing had control, and was viscious, not only to me but to those around me. It's the reason I am so scarred, it's the reason I hallucinate (audibly and visually) and I hate it, but I am responsible for it.
Few people know about it, no one but me knows how powerful and deadly this thing is. It scares me, but shining light on it seems to make it uncomfortable, so here I am doing that.

For those of you who don't believe this. That's fine, I don't need validation, or for people to believe, I just need to get this off my chest

Her son is not on speaking terms with her, and it has been this way for nearly a decade.  Personally I think the son is a jerk, but this woman blames the situation on the son's wife.  Where I feel that beyond being a bitch, the wife isnt at the controls in this issue, the son is just a dick, I sit on those feelings because I dont think it's my place to provide fuel to the fire.

Im often compared by the mom to the son (either the ""good"" son of the past or the neglectful son of the present depending on her mood). It drives me crazy, so I don't discuss her son around her.  When this happens, she typically takes my wife into another room and cries about the situation to my wife, which makes my wife crazy uncomfortable. But my wife is a pleaser, so she tries to listen, yet the same time she doesn't want to be any part of the conversation.

Recently I tried to respectfully inform the mother of this, after she became upset that I saw her daughter -in -law's sister at a friend's wedding but I refused to mention the mother's son to the sister in order to elicit information.

Throughout the conversation she became angered that
1)I talked to the sister without asking anything about her son (which the sister probably doesnt even know)
2)I didn't tell her that I talked to the sister
3)she believes that my wife is completely fine with sitting alone in a room with her and watching her cry about her son, and I'm the one overreacting trying to keep my wife away from that situation
4)She believes that the only reason I refused to tell her any information I have on her son (which, again, is either nothing or so incidental that it amounts to nothing), is because I got the information from afriend that I liked and wanted to suck up to (the bride in the wedding we went to... oh and these are her words.  Not summarizing. Also, I have only talked to that girl about two time in two years. she's a high school friend.)
5) She also thinks that is the only reason I went to the wedding was because I liked my friend, the bride and I would rather suck up to that friend than tell this mom the truth
6) She thinks that Im not being fair by her or my wife by not wanting my wife to be in a situation alone with her crying about her son, that if we considered her family that it wouldn't be a problem, and that the only reason it is a problem is because Im trying to run my wife off.
7) she asked me of a specific instance where my wife felt uncomfortable, and though I was uncomfortable telling her of the private conversations between my wife and I, I named a couple of instances just to bring my point across. She said I was lying.

I tried to state to her over and over that none of this was true, that if I had any pertinent info about her kid, I would let them know, but what info I do have is old news to everyone, and that Im not trying to be their secret agent. I tried to tell her that my wife and I didnt have anything against her and we understood and felt for her in her situation...We just had a problem with my wife being placed in that situation over and over again. 

Yet, everything I said kept getting twisted to something that was the complete opposite of not simply what I meant but what the facts showed.  Honestly, I felt completely disrespected by her multiple times in the conversation (i dont understand my wife, i'm lying to her, i'm trying to run my wife off to get with a married woman). But knowing her, i believe that she wouldn't be disrespectful on purpose.  thats why I think there is some disorder going on.

So far I've been to three appointments and my last appointment led to me FINALLY being diagnosed with something (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), but I apparently also have an unknown personality disorder.
Now, I have major interest in psychology and have research symptoms, read up on everything, and gave my therapist a few suggestions as to what I was believing it may have been. I didn't say ""this is what I have start treating me"", I simply mentioned my two suggestions as to what I felt was the closest symptom wise.

The first being Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I listed my symptoms, explained why I believed mostly that it may be this. I told her I had frequent mood swings that weren't long term and were happening rapidly within seconds. These emotions are intense, lack of black and white feelings so I was either extremely angry, extremely depressed, or extremely happy and when I experience these, as I like to call, episodes, they seem to be over just as quickly as they started up. This is when I go on the plane of numbness as I call it. I feel no emotion I'm just tired. There are a handful of other things that go on that also lead me to this, my constant paranoia of being abandoned (which happened, my ex left me saying I was a piece of shit for being mentally ill and all this other shit. I cut off contact with him), making up things that aren't really happening in relationships with people (i.e. He's not talking to me, he's cheating on me. He's ignoring me. He doesn't want me anymore, so on and so forth), I begin to think really silly things at times that make zero sense and are illogical as far as about normal everyday things and relationships, everything is boring to me now even if I used to enjoy it. It's just a mess that causes me to stress and panic.

Now, I know this mood disorder is something major. I know it can lead to MANY problems in my life and make it very difficult to hold relationships, but the point of me bringing it up was the fact I was showing a lot of the symptoms and I know I listed a few, but those were the ones I could think of right now with my brain being so foggy. My therapist and I discussed this at the last appointment:

Mania/Bipolar is out of the questions since my mood swings aren't more long term (lasting only seconds instead of days), Borderline Personality Disorder was ruled out for ONE reason being ""you were in a relationships for two and a half years so you can't have BPD""... What? From my understanding it's 5 or more symptoms and you have been diagnosed. I show up to 8. The logic behind it not being BPD and it being ""unknown"" was being able to hold onto a horrid relationship for two and a half years. It had never been stable, him and I were always walking on glass, and I would rip it all to shreds in a matter of seconds if I could WITH ZERO REASON and I loved this guy, I still do, we were doing great until I started getting sick and symptoms got worse. The duration of my relationship should have nothing to do with it... but the QUALITY should.

Anyway, I walked out of the office extremely confused as to what my unknown personality disorder is and they have zero clue what it could be. The only thing brought up about it was my anxiety is causing it, but I've had anxiety my whole life and I've never been like this as far as my emotions spinning how they are. I don't know. I just wonder if I should seek another opinion or switch therapists.

I left out info about myself so I'll include that. I'm a 17 year old female who literally has zero clue what to do anymore. I also forgot to mention my second idea was early schizophrenia, which I knew wasn't too close, but a few signs were there, but I wasn't exactly 100% set on this might be it and brought it up simply to see what my therapists thoughts were.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My therapist has no clue...

Last night I had an what alcoholics call a ""moment of clarity"" after reading this article. I don't agree with the author on all of his points, especially the ""drama"" bits, because I avoid drama like pregnancy, but the emotional and communication aspects are dead on. 

We self select each other. Mike make's a really good point: 

Their [the woman's] emotional instability stimulates your suppressed emotions. Men who are uncomfortable with their emotions suppress them in a few different ways. They numb themselves completely and feel indifferent towards others, or they rationalize reasons to avoid engaging others emotionally. 
When men suppress their emotions and shun intimacy, the only women whose emotions are intense enough to break through are women who are emotionally unstable. These men, by suppressing themselves, unknowingly self-select women who over-express themselves. These men tend to get particularly hooked on these over-emotional women because it allows them to experience their own emotions vicariously through the drama of the woman they’re with.
Let's use Jefe as an example. I met him on the internet shortly after my breakup with the Nerd. Successful, attractive, charming, and smart. There was something about him that I was instantly attracted to. I was still vulnerable. I'm still not sure what healthy communication looks like. I digress.

I kissed him outside the bar on our first date. ZING! Chemistry. Back to my place. I blew him on the first date. My rationale was that we had insane chemistry and sex was inevitable, so why wait? I told him as much and asked him not to judge me on it. He was into my aggressiveness and wanted to see me again.

And he did.

It didn't take long to find out that Jefe was carrying some major baggage of his own. The second time I tried to go to sex town with him, he could not get it up. 

Big man, big dick, big disappointment. He had to explain. His on and off girl of ten fucking years had killed herself recently. In his words, ""she cursed my boner"". But I was intensely attracted to him. He made me feel special in a way I hadn't felt since things I had been in an emotionally abusive relationship for years.

I was willing to make it work. And I did. I'm good.

The sex was amazing. We hung out all night. I met all his friends. They told me what a great guy he was. He made me feel special and important and I really liked him. We had great times. Oh yeah, brain off, emotions ON.

Then something happened. He got stressed. A new, very big business project. We had just gotten back from a long weekend. He wasn't returning my text messages. It was days. I was insecure. WHY WASN'T HE RESPONDING??? DID I DO SOMETHING????

He finally got back to me a week later, telling me he had a lot on my plate and just didn't feel like talking and that I was acting crazy.

So I gave him his space. He came back around. But this time it was different. It was only about sex. 

That's been the pattern, keeping me at an emotional distance using immature communication and sex. 

Why do I do this to myself? I don't think I could be with someone who couldn't handle my sexual impulsivity and emotional instability. So we go back to the self selection thing again. I think if I could find a guy like Jefe who could express himself using his words and not just his cock, I would find my Holy Grail. 

But it's not just Jefe. So many men in our culture are taught that it not appropriate to express emotions, which is so destructive, not just for them but for society. It dismisses normal or overly sensitive emotional responses to immature communication and apathy as mental illness, which it is not.

Later, I got heavily bullied by a group of girls, and one girl especially singled me out. I cried at home so many days. As I got older my mom passed it off as a teenage-rebel phase, calling me lazy and I was only doing things for the ""shock-factor"". When I cut myself pretty deeply on my outer thighs I was ""stupid and looking for attention"". When I toyed with suicide with a whole bottle of benzodiazepine, I was also ""stupid"". I don't cut anymore, but I can't help from hitting myself sometimes. It does leave bruises.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety (and possibly others) for a few years. Never went to see a doctor about it. I felt like they were quite moderate but the reality is that I've dropped out of college twice, haven't left the house much in a few months, and I used to drink 4-8 energy drinks a day (just recently quit). I felt and feel incapable of getting a job or finishing college.

Now, about 2 weeks ago, I decident to quit the caffeine and smoke some weed to relax a bit. For me, smoking weed is something rare. Once every few months a while back and then maybe once a year. It has always made me jittery and anxious. But this time it was different. The first couple of days, it was really pleasant. (This was also my first time smoking a few days in a row ever.) Then about the fourth day or so, I smoked too much and had a horrible trip. Jittery, shaking, feeling really bad and weird (don't know if it was DR/DP). However, it did not subside like a normal weed trip would. Days passed and I was feeling horrible. My anxiety was now almost permanent, stronger, and also felt different. Depression didn't feel like it used to, there was this odd, different, feeling in the back of my mind almost at all times, that I found very difficult to deal with. I couldn't eat much despite being very hungry. I also had HPPD-like visual disturbances, and sensitivity to sound, even though cannabis was never really hallucinogenic for me (and no, it didn't seem laced). My head felt like it was physically vibrating for most of the day. Reading stories about others who experienced similar things with cannabis and got stuck like this forever horrified me. Toughts about suicide started creeping even though I was never suicidal, no matter how bad my depression. I couldn't calm down at all and was really, really, scared.

BUT, and this is the strange part, some unexpected good things started to happen. I started to think about my life more (or differently, I can't quite describe it). I ""reminded"" myself of how much I love my parents, my grilfriend. I wanted to go out, take walks. I wanted back to college. I cried and was emotional. I wanted to just hang out with my parents whey they came back from work. Slowly, some of the bad effects started to subside a bit, at least at times. I still feel bad but, one of the most important things that happened is that I wanted to go see a doctor. Honestly, I've always wanted this, but just couldn't (like many other things I wanted to do). So I went and he put me on paroxetine (Seroxat) 20mg and sulpiride (Eglonyl) 50mg. I took the first paroxetine pill today and can already notice some effects (placebo?).

I used to have HPPD-like disturbances before this too, recently, but they were milder. It was only the occasional bright spots, mild tunnel-vision, and (real) dark spots in my peripheral vision attracting my attention. Now some lines move a bit, I see vibrating lines on some colour spots, afterimages are more pronounced, and I notice floaters a lot more. Could all of these be due to my increased anxiety?

I figure the good effects were because of the scare (they are also subsiding, but the experience remains. It has been an important lesson). What about the bad? Have you heard anything like this, or similar, before? Any insight as to what has happened?

Thank you.

I've turned to the internet for help brainstorming ways to change the stigma of mental health, does anyone else have any good practical ideas?

About me:  I'm currently a medical student in the US and I left my career in engineering specifically to pursue my interests in the science behind mental health.  

My Take:  I think there’s a lot of confusion out there about what constitutes a mental health condition that needs attention.  This is evidenced by the fact that in a class of medical students being taught about the various conditions that have been identified there was even confusion.  I also think that a lot of diagnostic terms get thrown around in the public out of context as slang (ex, “My girlfriend can be so BIPOLAR sometimes” or “I am so OCD when it comes to doing the dishes”).  In addition, there’s a stigma around mental health, people believe that seeking help makes them weak, defective, different.  

How do we change the stigma with the current state of mental health care?  How do we create a world where pathologic changes in behavior and personality are recognized early and addressed?  I think a big part of the problem is that for a lot of people, the idea of seeking help modifying behavior is suggesting a fundamental personal flaw.  It also suggests that there is a way everyone should act, societal conformity and a loss of individuality and what makes someone who they are.

We need to convey that the issues addressed in mental health care are not ones of individuality, it’s not about making sure we are all acting the same in accordance with some universal governing principle that tells everyone how to act.  We are trying to help people who have a diminished quality of life, whether that’s through inability to keep a job, addiction, abusive relationships etc.

People with severe illnesses find their way to help in various ways (bipolar, schizophrenia).   Others who could benefit from mental health often live with the condition assuming it is who they are (personality disorders) or are unaware anything is wrong due to the egosytonic nature of them.

I have an uncle who is diagnosed and though it only increases my chance 2-4% I'm more or less, scared.

I keep having the thought in my head, ""I do not want schizophrenia"". I'm trying to catch myself when this happens and be more positive. So instead of focusing on the negatives, I substitute that phrase with, ""I want to be mentally healthy."" Just to lessen my anxiety and focus on the bigger picture.

I've already made a doctors appointment and I plan on consulting him but I was wondering if I could get further information. I don't hear voices at all but today, I got up from my nap and was in the bath when I heard [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQVy2_TPcBo). Mind you, it isn't exact and my own melody seemed to be softer, slower, and shorter (under 15 seconds) but it frightened me to say the least.

It felt real and as though the sound was coming from another room. When I lived overseas, it was the same melody I heard everyday for the ice cream truck however, I'm in a rural area so I ruled that possibility out. I searched the house trying to find it but I had no luck so now I'm turning to the possibility I may have experienced my first audio hallucinogen.

I went to do research however, there seemed to be little information if none at all, about schizophrenics hearing music and primarly only voices. I also considered that because I just woke up, I may have been in a dream state to an extent.

It scares me so badly to think I may have this disease. I've just got offered my dream job, I'm going to University, and I want to travel and have a family. I don't want to end up as ill as my uncle.

So can someone give their opinion what's happening, is this a symptom of schizophrenia?

I waste whole days somehow, when I know there's work to do. And it's even work I enjoy when I get down to it! (I'm a grad student)

Some days it's fine... I get up when my alarm goes off, get maybe six hours of good quality work done, do housework as necessary. But this only happens once a week or so... Other days I get maybe an hour done before I get distracted or no longer ""feel like it"" or claim to myself that I need to ""think over"" some idea. The latter might even be true sometimes, but a lot of the time it seems like an excuse.

Some days I wake up in the morning and all the good reasons I had to get up at that time get overruled by arguments like ""if I sleep more now I'll work better later"". Usually those days don't end up with any work at all. Throughout the days there are always new arguments to fight against... I'll just do this first, etc. It's like an engine won't start and in the absence of it running, distraction takes over.

It doesn't feel quite like laziness or depression. I'm not generally unhappy, just frustrated by this! And the ""good days"" show that I am capable of being a real human being... They happen often enough that I can ""get away with it"" and so don't (usually) as for help, but it doesn't seem normal or right or fulfilling to just work one or maybe two days a week. Also it seems like they're occurring less frequently, and I can't make them happen on demand... A couple of weeks ago I really forced myself for a day for a deadline, and it did not go well. It was like dealing with a wild animal inside my head that did not want to be caged. I couldn't do anything for over a week afterwards... It was like my brain was on strike.

That's the general theme here really: I feel like I'm living at the whim of my subconscious, merely acting like a PA for it by maximising opportunities to roam free... rather than being in control of it. It's always been this way I think, but up until now I've just been willing/able to see where it went, and it's always taken me somewhere interesting. Now it seems like it doesn't want to do anything useful 90% of the time!

I can't keep going like this (I need to start putting consistent work into writing my thesis rather than just exploring as fancy takes me), but I don't know what to do to fix it. I've tried a hundred ""tricks"" like complicated alarms, meditation, going to the gym on a regular schedule, different sorts of schedule (lax and tight), changing my diet, working in public places and many more. They all seem to work for a little while (most just once or twice) and some are useful in other ways (eg fitness) but it always reverts to the old sort of patterns. It's like there's something inside my head actively working against any efforts to up the ratio of work, but rather than communicating this (or why) directly it has to influence my thoughts indirectly.

Any advice welcome... I don't even really know what I'm dealing with here. A lack of self-discipline? A rampaging toddler inside my head that happens to be the source of my talents?

But all of these things mean nothing in the face of the numerous mental disorders that I'm currently trying to deal with:

- depression
- anxiety
- OCD
- self-harming behaviour
- severe bulimia

I'm in such mental agony that it hurts physically, if that makes any sense at all... I'm crying so hard that my chest hurts, which only makes me more upset and anxious.

I know full well that I could have a heart attack and just drop dead at any time.

I have all of the support that anyone could ever ask for. My parents and two younger sisters are beautiful, loving people; I couldn't ask for a better family. 

I work for a very small company, and the owner and his wife are some of the most amazing and generous people I've ever met. They're more than just my bosses - they're a second family to me. In fact, they're the only people who know about all of my issues, and know just how fucked up I really am. They've been so amazingly supportive. They're even paying for me to go and see a clinical psychologist once a week - something that I could never afford on my own.

When I stop and think about all of the opportunities I've had... all of the help I've been given... It only makes me feel more disgusted with myself. I feel like total shit. How could I have wasted all of this? Why can't I stop binging and purging? Why can't I stop crying myself to sleep every night? Why can't I stop worrying all of the time? Why can't I stop giving in to all of the compulsions that haunt me every minute of every day?

I've been given every chance to succeed, so why do I keep failing? I feel like the worst fucking failure ever.

My Dad is 67 years old. He is retired, lives on his own, has a very comfortable lifestyle and keeps himself busy. He's very smart. He's well read, reasonably healthy, enjoys DIY, likes trams and old railways, enjoys a good pint of mild/ale with old friends and has quirky interests in stuff like old polyphons and fairground organs. Emotionally, however, he's quite shutdown, angry, cynical, bitter and has a tendency to rubbish everything. Even when he's praising something, you can tell he's struggling to be sincere.

His background is very turbulent. I know, from what my Mum told me, that his father was a ""tyrant"". His father paid for his sister (my Auntie) to go to university but only gave him the equivalent of £10 and refused to pay for him to go, even though he really wanted to study engineering, he missed out on something he was really passionate about. Also, his mother died when he was very young (when he was 12 I think).

Then because his sister didn't like their father, she moved away and wanted nothing to do with him, leaving my dad to bear the brunt of his father's mental abuse. She later had two boys who are now 34 (married with kids) and 40 (suffered brain damage when he was 12yo in a bike accident on his way to school; wasn't wearing a helmet and ended up under the wheel of a lorry). She's a little older than my dad and takes anti-depressants, which makes her talk very slowly (more than she used to) and she is very painful to listen to. But we hardly see that side of the family as there's bad history there as well.

In 2001, my Mum and Dad separated because my Dad messed up their silver wedding anniversary, and it was the final straw for my mum who had had enough of his bad temper and angry outbursts. Our house was not a pleasant place to live in. I'm 30yo, and he was very difficult to live with back then. So my mum, myself and my sister (now 33), all moved out in one day when he was at work without him knowing. I was 17 at the time and preferred the idea of living with my mum and sister, over treading on eggshells if I lived with my dad. After moving out, I felt extremely guilty and masked that guilt by throwing the blame at my mum for not trying harder to resolve the issues, but for everything she'd been through and from what I know of my dad, it was an extremely tough decision to make, as he was and is an extremely difficult person to be around.

Anyway, my dad has been through and experienced abandonment, having a family, financial pressure, bereavement (lots of our relatives died in the late 90's), family issues between my mum and my dad's sister (never liked each other, my dad was always caught in the middle) and isolation I guess, now that he lives alone.

On family visits, days out, and when we're together as a family (me, my sister and my mum &amp; dad), he becomes very irritable and has some very odd mannerisms and behaviour that drives us up the wall.

One thing he does is, when we're going out somewhere and he's driving, he'll start saying something really quietly (almost like he's doing it on purpose) and we, in the back, can't hear what he's saying. So we'll say something like ""I'm sorry, could you say that again, I didn't hear you"", and he'll go from one extreme to the other. So he starts shouting. And we're like ""what the fuck?!"", and it alienates us in the car causing an atmosphere. There's no middle ground for him. He goes from very quiet to very shouty. So we end up having a very awkward, silent car journey. So if he says something, we usually end up just ignoring him and pretending we didn't hear anything.

He's also very prone to fuck-ups when organising things (again, like he's doing it deliberately) and will generally blow his top any chance he gets. So any opportunity there is to rubbish something, he will do it.

So I don't know what to do, because it's been an issue that's plagued us for a very long time as a family, for most of our lives and he's not going to change anytime soon. We can have some good times but usually, his behaviour gets too erratic.

I think he would benefit from therapy but if I told him that, he would probably get offended and lose his shit. So I end up thinking I should probably try and talk to him, but it would be emotionally exhausting and I don't even know if it would work or if he would understand.

In my eyes, he's a quirky old retired inventor/engineer who has taken care of his family as best as he could but has had to put up with so much shit the average guy couldn't cope with and would probably kill themselves over, that he has probably shut himself down emotionally and given up.

So I've never really known my dad or felt connected to him, and I want that to change before it's too late.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I think my Dad might have had a mental breakdown (possible a few) and has never recovered.

I was on a sleep schedule where I would get 1-4 hrs of sleep a day, but skip a day or three occasionally. However, I did this because I was paranoid, I kept seeing things and I kept hearing things. I've always been a paranoid person, but I would skip meals and drink little to avoid getting poisoned. It's also unlikely I don't have ocd, with intrusive thoughts and a fear of being dirty being the main symptoms. 

So I guess at one point I started popping melatonin, with occasional avail. I then had an okay sleep schedule and my craziness was a bit better. I should also mention, I'm a bit of a shut in. I don't see other people except when I go to school or the gym, and even then I avoid people.

My visual hallucinations were crazy, I would see the room fill with smoke, see vague people who weren't there, the walls would breath, and objects would warp and change size. They used to be more prominent. The auditory hallucinations were about as constant as the visual, but less scary. The tv would say my name, the tv would sound on unless I went to it, footsteps, explosions occasionally, whispers, and then the more prominent voices.

Now I would say I'm as stable as I've been in forever, but the prominent voices are back a little bit, with some visual surprises as well. The prominent voices have two categories. One: outside my head, only when I'm alone. I'll have conversations with one in particular about things I can't remember, but I remember arguing. This guy sounds like a politician, and is accompanied by several others speaking all at once to the point I can only make out a phrase or word. Two: My voice in my own head, not controlled by me.

I'm a 24 year old guy in the UK.

I've always been a relatively high achiever, but since the age of around 14 - 15, I've had nowhere near the same ability to actually do anything with it. I procrastinate a lot. I have lots of unfinished projects. I can't talk very slowly or clearly. My handwriting and spelling skills are falling further and further behind my other skills. I'm always fidgeting/tapping. I've always gnawed my nails to literally bloody stubs.  I get distracted easily. Even within my family, my nickname is centred around my inability to complete even tasks like making a cup of tea. I'm not particularly social these days. I'm not entirely sure I fully ""get"" emotions or some social/cultural cues or constructs. This is an issue because I feel I'm wasting half my life doing things like getting distracted, staring into space, biting my nails, repeating myself because I said something too fast/in an unclear manner etc. I feel I'm only reaching 10% of my potential because I spend the rest of the time procrastinating.

However, I've been raised to have broad shoulders and a sturdy head. The idea of mental health issues from my Dads side is that it's all nonsense, despite all of my brothers having either one or more diagnosis including dyslexia, bipolar disorder and depression. But the view that's been projected onto me from my dad, which I sort of agree with, is that I'm me - these ""problems"" are actually my ""features"" as an individual. But by that logic, I don't have any issues, per say, I'm just not coping very well with being myself.

Leading on from that, I really fear I'll have problems convincing anyone that this is an issue. I came out with a high 1st class degree in computing, turned down a Masters degree and one of the top 5 uni's in the world to accept a full scholarship for a PhD which I hope to finish before I turn 25. I don't feel I can talk to my family or my girlfriend about this, because I feel, from the outside, that my life is brilliant and I'm incredibly fortunate in where I've got to compared to others. 

Another aspect to this whole pickle is drugs. I've a history of recreational, occasionally problematic, drug use from the age of 16 including ""uppers, downers, horse tranquillizers, cow paralysers"" and the rest. From this, and other things, I've learnt that I have an incredibly addictive personality. I still do some recreational drug taking (I'm a regular ""smoker"" of something which isn't tobacco, because I've found it to be one of the few things which can slow my head down) but I'm wary of both taking new drugs (because of dependence) as well as coming across as drug seeking.

So I'm not really sure what to do, or how. I don't feel I have a lot of time spare to be able to pursue getting this sorted out or looked into - in the small bits of research I have done, a lot of long term issues tend to need long term evidence to get any useful diagnosis in the UK, but since I hate going to the doctors, I've never really mentioned it (although I had some college provided counselling.) I don't really want to have to take medication. I don't really have anybody who I'd be comfortable speaking about it with. I'm not even sure if I should get it looked into, if it's even an issue or if it's just me needing to ""man up""?

Does anyone have any insights, advice, or similar experiences?

She is not someone I want to share my life details with.  She used to call every few weeks and I could handle that even though she spent the first half of ever call reminding me that my brother and I abandoned her for our adult lives and now she's sad and alone, except when she volunteers at the state school.  She told me she tried to get admitted there but they wouldn't take her.  

She had a health scare and now emails or calls me every few days practically begging me to tell her things about my life.

I feel completely invaded and have nothing to tell her.  If she wanted a ""close"" offspring she shouldn't have made fun of me when I had serious problems as a kid and teenager, yelled at me when I was having introvert anxiety days and couldn't come out of my room, and maybe just maybe she needs to go see a therapist along with taking a dozen different types of pills that seem to do all of jack squat.  She saw a therapist a few times but quit and can't seem to explain why.  She can't explain ANY of her mental health issues and my dad just acts like ""she is how she is and you just need to humor her"" which, in my somewhat educated opinion is a cop-out and a dangerous idea.

I understand that she raised me, she dealt with my medical issues as a kid, and we live in a society that crams ""LOVE YOUR MOTHER"" down our throats despite the mother's actions.  But there's just nothing I want to tell her about in my life.  Especially not 3 emails and a phone call worth each week.  ""I get up, I clean the house, I job hunt, I eat, and I watch netflix or play video games.""  What the hell am supposed to be telling her??  Certainly not about my internal struggles about whether or not my husband and I should have a kid, or the volunteer work I do, or my life's hopes and dreams.  I don't even share that with FRIENDS.  I AM A GODDAMN LONER INTROVERT AND AM CONTENT TO BE THAT WAY!  Sorry for yelling.

I'm so tired of being expected to open myself up to this person who a) can't even remember which email is mine so she sends them to 5 different email addresses and WILL NOT STOP using the ones that belong to some poor stranger.  and b) has issues I CAN NOT HELP WITH but will not see a therapist.

I feel like I'm being harassed by someone who is harmless but persistent and the police won't take me seriously.  Dad keeps telling me to ""just talk to her"" and I just have nothing to say.

She makes my anxiety go through the roof, but I'm supposed to be tiptoeing around HER.  What about me and how she affects me??  

I've posted here before a few times and gotten zero responses so I guess I'm just using it to type it out.  Again.  Nobody can tell me what to do.  All the things I can think of I have done.  She bursts into tears when I mention seeing a therapist.  Dad scolds me when I make her cry.  He won't talk about it aside from to say I should be talking to her more.  That makes me feel like they blame ME for the way she is.  She is an unfiltered extrovert in a family full of very very guarded introverts.  My dad and brother are just like me but for some reason I'm the one who is suposed to ""save"" her because...  I dunno.  I'm the girl?  The youngest?

Well...  I have my own issues, mom, so all you are going to get is ""First I woke up, then I had a piece of toast, then I had a coffee on the balcony...""  No wait she will ask me if I have plants, what kind of coffee, and if there are birds.  Better stick to toast.

Hi everyone My name is Bryan, and i have some mental disorders, i have been diagnosed with Atypical Depression, Attention Deficit Disorder, and General Anxiety Disorder. the last one may or may not be a side effect of the depression. I want to talk about each of these and how they effect me in my life...

First things first. i am not a writer, i did run this through a basic spell check.. but in the long run i don’t care about grammar or spelling. i just want to get these words out.

Second this is for informational purposes only, do not use this to self diagnose. and this isn’t a pity me either just trying to get some words out.

The Depression.. this is the one people notice. It causes me to withdraw from my friends and loved ones.. but i want to get something straight first. Most of the time with depression i don't feel sad... I feel empty,.. vacant i can go from having a blast them once everything is done.. i feel nothing... and well if sadness was all i felt that would be better then the empty feeling i get.. it causes me to try things just to feel something.. and sometimes if all i can feel is sad its what i do.. other times its anger, I don't know if I’m explaining well enough but felling empty is worse then being over emotional... and well due to the atypical depression it sometimes switches to too much emotion...

How to explain... someday i feel nothing then out of nowhere i feel everything no gradual just bam.. over whelming emotion. from empty to either super happy super angry etc, and no this is not bipolar it is well atypical depression. it also do mess with other things. i get antsy i end up yelling at people i don’t want to yell at etc, and once i realize what i did its to late... It messes with my appetite as well, and when I'm upset i don’t want to eat.

Now for something darker, Suicide.. its real and depressed individuals are more likely to do it... for me its that voice saying veer off the road and maybe you can feel something, however I’m also stubborn which may have saved my life... i have work to do, plus i know how i would do it and would involve lots of planning... plus me committing suicide would end with causing problems then they solve.

Back to the thing at hand, if you know someone who is depressed don't be insulted by them not wanting to go out.. and well with me i wont go out on my own volition.. but sometimes being invited is enough or hell force me to go out don’t give me the option... how ever don't force me.. and no large amounts of people. but that’s just me.

My point being is well sometimes some friends who will listen is all it takes to bring someone back from the brink.. but don’t expect them to talk first go to them give them time, and a shoulder. Invite them to things, but do not force them to go along, but make sure if they do say they want to go make sure they don’t back out.

So yeah depression sucks.. but if you know someone who is depressed do what you can but don’t force them to be happy. just help them feel.

Adding a few things I’ve heard from people that well i find insulting..

""just don't feel sad feel happy"" well most of depression is feeling empty not sad (at least for me)
""you’re just depressed because you don’t have (god, Jesus, etc in your life)"" i don’t know where to start with this one. i know Christians suffer from depression so if that was the case.. plus i don’t really need god or the like.. i cant say if one exists or not but i live my life as if one does not.

Now for the anxiety, this is the second one people tend to notice especially if they are around me for quite some time.. this one i do not know if it has to do with my depression or not, the one can cause the other.

Anxiety comes in certain parts.. its actually make this hard to write, for me anxiety makes it difficult to express my opinion to talk to people. i just sit quite and try to stay away and well there are several things that can trigger it i have found. Meeting people i know ill meet again causes anxiety as does large crowds.. and well there are others but i haven’t figured out 1+1 and what causes it. it leads me to having panic and anxiety attacks.. the best way to explain an anxiety attack is imagine what happens when you get stage fright times that by 50 and have it happen out of the blue.. it causes you to panic and to cry and sometimes you’re not sure what situation causes it.. as i said large loud crowds, certain people... and well there are others but i have not figured out what does what.

I know i don’t have enough about anxiety as i did depression however its even screwing up with me right now.. and maybe someday i can write about those who cause my anxiety issues cause i do still see them from day to day and don’t want to burn bridges.

and i have heard one thing about this one
""you have no reason to feel anxious"" yeah i know that’s why this is a mental issue.

Now for the last one
Attention Deficit Disorder, please note i left out the H i am not hyperactive.. this one is actually the hardest to explain to others because due to over diagnosis, and well this one does not effect me as bad as the others, but just like the depression may cause the anxiety this one may make it worse.

Now I’ve had ADD for quite sometime so i know how to cope with it, its lead me to being able to multitask, but on the side i find it impossible to do one thing at a time. and this causes problems in classes, if forced to just listen to the instructor i cannot.. but if I'm doing something else at the same time i can do both both quite well. but it also makes it so i can't ignore things thus why crowds effect my anxiety

and well yeah i do get annoyed by people who use it as an excuse but from years of having it i have learned what works for me.

and again a quote

""ADD is just made up"" well sort of there are people who exaggerate it and use it as an excuse i say they should find the strengths and weaknesses and use those. I don’t do crowds well, not most classrooms, but i can multitask and retain a lot of information given to me.

So now that I’ve explained those and my side of things, I hope you learned something about me or someone who may suffer from one of these.. I’m also willing to answer any questions or if you need someone to talk to.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Mental Health &amp; ME

Mother had had worsening mania since my junior year of high school. She has been on and off medication, but consistently on it through most of my college years. Only recently had she gotten off it in the the last five months, I did not know this until I was driving home with my dad. She has also become extremely reclusive and leaves the house rarely. Her main unreasonable conspiracy theory that destroyed her social life and connections with friends was that we were being under surveillance constantly with people out to get us. As you can guess, with someone who says that for 5 years straight and is told they are being unreasonable, the Edward Snowden and NSA issue broke my heart because I knew my dad would have have to deal with the worsening condition. Now I have to deal with it as she went off her medication. 

I've had anger management issues in the past, but managed to drastically improve them to the point where they are no longer much of a problem except for her. It's not perfect but I know that I've gotten better is because the majority of my friends say they have seen an incredible improvement in my calmness and personality. She only sees me at my worst basically, just giving her more ammunition to belittle me. 

My two days home have consisted of this process. 

* she nags me

* I try and corporate and listen to her. 

* her demands become extremely unreasonable, fanatical, one of a crazy person. She refuses to help me complete any work but then criticizes how I do it constantly. 

* Ignore her or tell her I'll manage something like housework or cleaning myself. 

* she then comes back and criticizes my work. I just came back from college living with myself and cleaning up for many roommates, so my housework skills are perfectly manageable but not A+. (she used to be a hotel maid so has pretty high standards.). 

* she starts saying everything to bring me down. In cleaner language but just as mean, I'm a fuck up, I can't take care of myself, my friends are fuck ups, (most of us are very successful for our age and have just graduated from big ten Universities, with internships or jobs) basically an hour of critisism with no actual advice. Some non mental illness people might see a sentence or two as reasonable but the whole thing together, and just constant makes her seem like the worst helicopter mom in the world. I finally exploded on her, basically no respect at all with my language because respectful words have led me nowhere. Anything to get her to stop talking to me.

* we don't speak for days 

* some type of apology from her or just tempers cool

* repeat. 

I need more ways to cope than to just stay silent or just explode until she finally stops talking. Silence doesn't work because she increases her hounding to a higher level. Reasoning with her is like reasoning with a brick wall. She will just voice her disapproval at any choice you make without giving you anything that makes her happy about it. Impossible to please and impossible to get her to stop. At 22 I have stopped letting any of her opinions influence me, because I realized they only worked to hold me back or make me less happy. The only thing worthwhile she has taught me in the last few years is to use caution, but her way overboard approach with it has just worn out its welcome. My respect for her us at an all time low right now and I can't really see the mental illness in it anymore. I can't listen to her anymore and I can't move out immediately financially although that is a definite goal in about 4 months when I start my job. I don't want to even tell her about any of my friends or my girlfriend because she will just use it as ammunition to hurt me later when she's angry. The worst part is she gets some kind of sick enjoyment of seeing me frustrated with her.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Just moved back in after college today, took less than 24 for my manic/bipolar mother to set me off.

I was diagnosed with manic depression in high school. My parents were really emotionally abusive and it's come to a point where I just avoid everyone. My family's pretty messed up. My mom's an alcoholic. My dad also drinks a lot but he's not violent. I'm scared that my little sister's going to end up like me because whether mental illness is hereditary or not-- this family environment is toxic. I'm in no place to take care of anyone-- I can barely take care of myself. In fact, all of this has convinced me that I never want to get married or have kids. My philosophy is to simply be happy and happiness is a serious struggle.

My mom has these episodes where she gets super drunk and aggressive or suicidal maybe once or twice a month. Today she picked up a kitchen knife and I was scared that my dad was going to get stabbed. I had to literally rip the knife away from her hand. Every time she has these episodes my little sister breaks down. Maybe I should get my little sister a therapist?

My mom might have cervical cancer. I don't want to put her in a mental health facility because she can't speak English and I've been through the mental health system. I know how to get out of the system but someone like my mother, I'm afraid will become stuck.

I should be graduating college next semester and this family's simply toxic. The plan's to get away when I can and even then I don't know whether I'll be able to manage my bipolar. I don't know what to do about my mother or my little sister. I'd appreciate your help. 

Talking to them isn't really an option. They have 0 communication skills. They can't even communicate with each other in Korean.

I know we're not supposed to solicit diagnoses, but my girlfriend (18) is already in therapy and I need further help. She's seeing a university counselor about her anxiety and depression, but I don't think she's giving her therapist the full story and I wanted to see if any of you had experienced something similar or had any idea what it might be. We've been together for a few years and I'm trying my best to help her during university, which is tough but definitely worth it because she's an amazing person.

The first thing she opened up to me about were the panic attacks. These are fairly standard and triggered by a wide list of things - rough home life, fear of failure, making phone calls, etc.

Next I started noticing moments of extreme rage. This often happens online where she will post absurd, raging comments or things on FB or other sites, and then delete them in a few minutes and have no memory of doing it. This must seem very odd to her friends / other people online, but nobody has said anything to me. Honestly, it's my theory that she gets embarassed/scared of herself and just tries to deny that it happened. The biggest evidence in this direction is that often much later after she's calmed down, she'll talk about what it was that upset her with me. However sometimes she really seems to just repress it to the point that if she reads through her texts twenty minutes later or someone calls her on the online rage, she panics again, often leading to anxiety attacks. She often will randomly, instantly snap out of this anger/anxiety and say that she had fallen asleep or something similar. Mentioning anything she's done/said/posted online, even positive stuff, usually gives her anxiety as well. 

The only times I've seen this take physical form is her self-harming (relatively lightly) or hitting a wall. Her father has a history of severe anxiety that manifests itself in huge bouts of rage (where her rough home life came from). I see that in her and it's scary. Their family has a long history of thyroid issues, possibly causing the anxiety. She's getting tested for that now.

It all goes in cycles. Sometimes - for weeks on end - none of this happens. If it's a bad patch (misses home, pet passed away, etc), this stuff will be off and on constantly. I'm trying my best to help, but it's not like I can write all of this into an email to a therapist I've never met and can't meet (university policy and we go to different schools) so I don't know how they'll help when she doesn't acknowledge it herself. Does anxiety often lead to rage and repressed short-term memory? Any ideas of what this is or what to do are appreciated so much...

I started shaking and i felt like this isn't real life it cant be. I was even confused by the fact how i see. I hadn't eaten for 5 hours again?

And today i was at my friends house again. I haven't had this confusion long time but today it hit me again. That's what made me do this post now.

Last year I released a personal documentary about my experience as a redhead, and since then I've received lots of letters and messages from different people. A certain percentage are from people I suspect have some sort of mental health problem. Some people write me to tell me their stories, which is fine, but some of the messages, like one I got today, are a problem. The one I got today read as follows: ""My mother is from Texas. And she has a set if (sic) Texas dishes I am not allowed to eat off of because I was not born in Texas (like that was my fault). I can inherit these dishes if I have a red headed son born in Texas, conceived with a man from Texas. My son then has to attend a Texas university, becomes a doctor, and do his residency at MD Anderson in Houston. (If it is a girl, or my son doesn't choose to be a doctor, I do not get the full set of dishes.) Any chance you want to help me out with this."" (The letter goes on from there to explain why the dishes matter to her, and she again asks me to help her conceive a child.)

So I'd say that 1-2% of the messages I get are from people who I think have some sort of mental health issue. Now mental health is something I feel really strongly about, and I'd love to make a film that shows the problem in society with not having a strong enough system to support people with different issues.

The problem is that in order to make it a film, I need a main character, or two, and I need a story. One of my ideas was to go visit some of the people who've sent me strange letters to see what their stories are, but that's where I get into an ethical dilemma. I don't want to make them a laughing stock in public and potentially make matters worse for them.

I'm fine in normal social situations/parties etc, i have lots of casual friends and I'm always out and about, but i couldn't think of anything worse than getting to know someone properly and having to having to talk about feelings/emotions/anything beyond superficial chat. 
Lately i've tried pushing myself and going out on plenty of dates (via online dating). The first date is fine (because there is no real expectation, it can just be superficial chatting), the second date i'm freaking out the entire time and my instinct is to run, which i usually do halfway through the night as soon as conversation gets more than superficial or things start getting physical eg hand holding or looking into eyes close up, i completely freak out in my head and my body goes all cold and I feel so sick. It's really frustrating because i've met so many attractive guys who clearly like me and want to see me again but i just can't handle it. 

It's really getting to me as i've been single for so long, it’s getting really obvious and all my friends think completely weird. And a fear of connecting with anyone (friends or BF) has caused me to screw up a lot of relationships with people as soon as they want to spend more one on one time with me. E.G. a uni friend became a housemate then about 2 months in I stopped talking to her for around 8 months until I moved out. I only corresponded via email or text. I don’t even know why I did this, I just became terrified of anything but avoidance so I literally hid in my room and didn’t eat for long periods of time if she was in the house. I was completely fine socially if she was not around. And I’m terrified that this is going to happen with my current housemates. 
I’m getting lonely and want someone to share my life with, but I’m also much more comfortable alone as the thought of having to have a physical or emotional connection with someone makes me feel sick. Even looking in someone else’s eyes scares me. 

I'm definitely not asexual, i do want to have sex, I think about it all the time, I'm just too terrified to do so (and I think sex and all that goes along with it is pretty disgusting in reality). I've never been sexually assaulted or anything like that, I have no idea why I am this way. When I was really young I was diagnosed as borderline ADD apparently, but that hasn’t really affected my life and I can’t see how that would have anything to do with this?

So anyone have any ideas to help me out/direct me towards info that could help? Is there some type of therapy that can help me with this so i can have normal relationships? I’ve thought about seeing a psychologist but I don’t feel like talking about things (not like I can do that anyways…) or taking meds will help. Are there other people out there who are also exactly like this, for no apparent reason?

Tldr: deep fear of physical/emotional intimacy, no idea why, anyone know anything that will actually help me?

So I discovered that I have this light gynophobia problem. It's more like feeling uneasy, than straight up fear, and I have not hate whatsoever, toward women. In fact this is crippling because I can't find a mate. And I do like women.

While I have no issues communicating with anyone, male or female, I noticed that whenever I interact with a female stranger, I put up shields to protect myself. Will avoid eye contact, keep it short.

A recurring instance is... Long story short, I do outdoors training with a group of friends. We accept anyone and have a website. Sometimes we have girls who come and train. Whevener there is a girl I don't know, I tense up. Kind of like someone who is afraid of dogs is around a dog, I think (I'm not afraid of dogs, so I wouldn't know. Kinda ironic tough, dogs are much more dangerous). But after they come 2, 3 times, I stop having fear. If I have to interact with them before meeting them 2,3 times, it'll be short, ""dry"", and to the point.

Dates after dates are screwed up because my shields are always up.

It's not about confidence - I'm already confident, I can speak in front of groups. Altough an introvert, I'm not afraid to speak to people (anymore). Used to, but now I've worked on that and now it's easy. Still working on it, but I'm mostly fine. Increasing confidence won't work. Just like increasing confidence won't help make you safer around dogs or spiders - you need to learn to get to know your little furry friends. Point is, pushing the goalpost, (when you have a job, when you have a higher salary, when you're in college, when you're in univ...) is bad. You can get a girl NOW if you're average confidence, clean, normal. Plenty of people do, I can as well.

Contacted some psychological resources, should have a response friday pointing me to a cheap or free therapist.

This is not a serious issue, but it's still affecting my life.

As for the cause... While I had other problems affecting dating in my younger 20s, I turned to read some PuA bullcrap. Cleansed it out of my head, but maybe the Men right activism and false rape accusation, creepy men propaganda, and such, polluted my mind, so I'm scared of coming off as creepy. Maybe because it's really hard to read if a women is interested in you or not, so I subconsciously (half subconsciously) make sure they won't be, so no looking stupid. Maybe I need to learn what is objectively creepy or not, and signs a women is interested or not. Maybe my ignorance of those two

Whenever I drink a little, I'm less afraid of women. So I've had sex, from dating websites. Also a girlfriend when I was 18 and not afraid of women. I think the hard breakup helped for making me afraid. Trying to hit on women when depressed and failing didn't contribute. Feeling inadequate for screwing up the relationship, for being too clingy. But alcohol makes me anxious the next day (hard liquor only, wine's fine) so it's never good and there's no follow up. :/

Any advice? Thanks! 
Just like to remind you that pushing the goalpost and increasing my confidence won't help me. It's not a self confidence issue... I don't know what kind of issue this is but I don't feel inadequate. I just put myself on the defensive when there are women... as for why I wrote the reasons I believe cause my fear, above.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Very light gynophobia problem

Weird, I know.

For instance, a year ago, I made the mistake of getting involved with a guy who was attached. (Note: I did not intentionally go after him knowing this. I feel for him, and I guess he knew this so he deceived me. He told me he had broken up with his girlfriend, When he was in fact, still with her). Being so smitten, I hooked up with him really quickly and he started treating me differently. When she found out, he blamed everything on me and made up a bunch of shit about me - it was disheartening. She believed everything he said, and told a whole bunch of people at our college. It's ridiculous that I care considering I don't even know these people, but I'm paranoid that everyone knows and that if I met someone who knew (s)/he would immediately hate me. 

Anyway, so since that happened, everytime my parents come onto campus, I feel embarrassed for them to have to be seen with me. Even just around the city (my college is the main school in my state, and many of the students are from the city or live within 1/2 hours), I feel terrible that they have to be seen with me. Even now, a year later.. The feeling is actually stronger than before. 

Another time is, years ago, at the end of elementary/throughout my middle school years, I was bullied really badly. I was really, really shy and it was primarily my ""best friend"" spreading all these false rumors about me. (i.e. She made a fake email, pretended to be me and fabricated 'my' sexual fantasies, INCLUDING people from our school in them, and sent them to alot of people in school.) At the time, I was so innocent I didn't even really know what sex was but I had people calling me all these names, and laughing to my face, etc. I was miserable and ashamed, and for middle school graduation I didn't even want my parents to come to my school. I was ashamed, even though I didn't do anything wrong, and I don't want people to be like OH they are the parents of this disgusting person. 

I've looked on the internet and I haven't been able to find someone else who has felt the same way... I don't know what is wrong with me. Why do I feel this way, how do I stop? It is a terrible feeling..

Just trying to figure out what could be wrong because she won't get help herself.**

I realize everyone here is not a doctor and I am not seeking a diagnosis, just merely reaching out to understand what could be the culprit of my mother's mental illness and get some support. I didn't see any rules in the sidebar against this. She has previously been diagnosed with and is medicated for OCD and depression. Around everyone but my father and on very rare occasions my brother and myself, she is adorable, kind-hearted, and a sweet woman known for her good soul. She has abused painkillers and ambien in the past decade (but had a breathrough last year and we believe is fully clean now), and I saw her ""other side"" once when we confronted her after finding a stash of pills she had stolen from my dad who had rotator cuff surgery. She was very defiant, screaming at us and bringing up past wrong my father has done- basically displacing the blame away from the problem at hand. Now she owns her own business and seems very happy and back to my old mom, but dad still will occasionally reveal fights that occur between them that I believe are actually a daily struggle. Saturday I called her cell phone to chat and he answered, very afraid and wondering if he should call the police. 

For background, she has packed up her stuff and left my dad for a few days many times. She even was recently looking for houses where her family lives. He doesn't try to make her stay, and I think in fact wishes she would just go so they could be happy again separately. Every time, she comes back, but tells him she hates him constantly, she is leaving and taking everything they have, etc (she has never really worked until now, and he has always been a workaholic and now they are very well off). Saturday, he found a sheet of paper in her purse that has been documenting his every move i.e. ""He said he was going to be in X this weekend but stayed an extra day to play golf with coworkers, etc."" Basically trying to prove he is lying and/or cheating on her. He approached her about it and asked what was going on, and she lost it. She screamed at him for a few minutes, tried to leave on the golf cart to a neighborhood party to tell everyone he was ""fucking someone else"". While trying to leave she slammed their small dog in the door (who is her baby) and didn't even react or show remorse at all. The dog laid in the floor for a minute and the rest of the night hid from her. He took the keys and said she needs to calm down and talk to him. She hit him repeatedly (he is a bigger guy so he just blocked her hand) ran upstairs, and proceeded to break every piece of glass she possibly could. She tore the shower curtains down, threw candlestick holders, and put holes in the wall, busted picture frames. When he went to check on her to make sure she hadn't hurt herself or something, she was totally naked and screaming and crying with glass everywhere. She locked herself in another bedroom up there and my dad went to check again and left some water for her outside of the room if she needed it. A few minutes later, he heard the door open, and the glass and water thrown at the hallway ceiling.
 
Later, she tried to take the dog from him while it was hiding behind him, and he said ""please don't, she is scared"". She screamed ""Annie is scared of YOU!"" My father sent me photos of all the damage in the upstairs. It is really bad. He wishes that he would've taken video because my mom has always painted him as evil and finally her family could have at least seen hard evidence of his side of the story. He says that if she had had access to a gun in that moment, he truly believes she would have shot him or herself. 

Does anyone have any idea what could possibly have caused an episode like this? She is completely defiant when you say she needs help and will never admit that she is being irrational. My dad isn't perfect-he can be controlling and bossy, but I don't believe he is cheating. Regardless of that or not, her behavior suggests there is a real problem and I worry for her (and his) safety. 

Thank you for reading this long story, and I hope to hear from those who suffer from similar issues and really just want to understand what her erratic behavior might be attributed to. I love my mom so much and miss who I know she is inside. Thanks so much reddit.

I've been diagnosed in the past with major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, and general anxiety. So generally I'm a mess, but I'm normally an emotion-feeling, environment-conscious mess. For the past year I've been feeling this really heavy fog, almost like a glass window, that I can't really get through. A lot of things really feel fake, or like I'm in a first-person video game; I'm petting my dog, but really all I see is a hand petting this thing in front of me. I constantly question what I like or who I am, to the point that it's hard to ever make a decision, and I'm starting to have trouble comprehending things I used to understand very well. I can barely remember what I ate for breakfast, let alone anything I did yesterday at all. It really bothers me, and I'm at a total loss. I didn't really know what depersonalization or derealization were until I ran across a comment about how stress can lead to these things, and so now I'm assuming this foggy disconnected feeling is probably DR. I don't think I have the actual personality disorder.

After reading into it a little more all I could really find was DP/DR goes away with time, especially if it's caused by stress and anxiety (which I think mine could be), and that stresses me out MORE. I can't sit around and wait for it to go away, and the things to combat depression (exercise, diet, journaling, whatever) aren't helping, either. Some say to wait for the stressor to pass, but I don't have time. I'd like to see a therapist, but my job doesn't offer insurance and medicaid still hasn't gotten back to me despite my application being submitted in December (""they process them in order so just wait,"" they told me.)

My mom was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 lung cancer last year. I thought I was handling it pretty well, but the stress is probably becoming to much, and has festered as this foggy disconnection. She was fine through December, but began getting progressively worse these past few months, and I can't even enjoy the time I have with her, because I feel so god damn disconnected from it all. I look at her and it feels like I'm not even in the same room. I don't want to waste this time I have left with her. I can barely remember anything I've said to her in the past couple of weeks, because I felt so disconnected that I just did not register any of it to my memory. I don't want to waste this time ...! I don't know what to do.

I'm not looking for answers, I just needed to vent, but any words are welcomed. Thank you for reading this, if you did. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"no idea how to handle DR/DP, feel like I'm running out of time to spend with dying mother"

I don't really want one, but I notice I am drawn to people who have them. I should probably tell some stuff about myself first.

I am a 16 year old male. I have a good, supporting family. I have multiple brothers. I am the fourth. I have a decent amount of friends. A healthy amount.

So, like I said, I wanted to be insane. I started forcing myself to think darker thoughts. I never do anything violent. Maybe a small fight with a brother. Actually, one day, a kid kept flicking me. I told him to stop or I would break his fingers. He did it and I bent them, but did not break them. He cried.

I figured this was just a phase and it would past, but I am finding myself more awkward. I stutter a little and I will catch myself just staring at something. More of a glare. Sometimes people don't think I notice them looking at me, but being a smart kid, I always notice. 

Sometimes, I get super angry. Not at anything in particular.

The thing is, none of these ""dark thoughts"" translate to my actions. I smile at people and respond in the way I think I should. No'one I know hates me.

One more thing, sometimes I feel like I am better than everyone. I look down on people for no reason. I will call myself god as a joke. I don't know why, but I feel like I can obtain a great amount of power if I want.

So my mother was sexually abused as a child by her farther. And her relationship with my dad was awful to say the least. When I was younger she would go from being a perfect mother to spending days in bed from her depression, flat out ignoring me and my sister. only to go on as if nothing happened. My dad always had work but was generally an angry drunken arsehole. When I was 18 her and my farther split up for the second time, after throwing each other about the house in a fight that happened because my dad decided to cheat on my mum. Once they had split up she just lost all control over her issues. Me and my sister were old enough to look after ourselves this time so she didn't need to be strong for us like when we were little. So she just went crazy. 

Shes convinced (via self internet diagnosis) that she has [menstrual psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_psychosis) but based on what I've read I doubt it. She drinks heavily and blames everything on having menstrual psychosis saying its all out of her control. she wont seek help other than asking to have her ovaries removed (which she is told she can not). I cant do this anymore, I don't want to loose her, I love her for having been as strong as she was when I was young, she's done more for me and my sister than I could ever thank her for. But her mental health is really affecting mine and my sisters. I'm struggling to be happy in anyway shape or form, I feel cold to the world and everything in it because that's how I've always coped when being confronted with the things I went through growing up. It was easier not to care rather than face up to what was happening but now I struggle to care about the things I really should care about. Now me and my sister are moving out and she's going to be alone for the first time in a long time and its only making things worse. I dont want to abandon her but I need to have some space and learn how to be a grown up. What options do I have in trying to help her? We're in the UK by the way.

I've been tenuously diagnosed with depression by a school counselor, and have been for a while. Long enough that my lack of action led to a separation between my girlfriend and I.

But that isn't the worst of it. I think I may be paranoid.

I mean I think I have been for a while. But it wasn't really an issue before. I just kind of sat, listened, and tried to talk as little about myself as possible. But it's getting out of control.

For me, at least, paranoia is about doubt. You think about something normal, find an ulterior motive, try and reassure yourself that that is ridiculous, and then question yourself repeatedly.

The first real paranoid episode was a few weeks ago. I thought my girlfriend and her best friend (both female and bi) were conspiring to set me down gently and form their own relationship. It was like a puzzle assembling before me... Everything pointed toward that, but she told me that wasn't what was happening, but I still doubted. That's part of what led to the separation. 

I was so disoriented with life at that time I couldn't keep my days straight. I thought something happened nine days ago when it actually happened four days ago. I'm glad I don't remember what I sounded like then...

I was driving home maybe three days ago from lunch with a friend. My house is a weird neighborhood, so the streets are usually pretty empty. But there was a black jeep behind me. I couldn't see the driver through the windshield. I thought I was being followed... And then told myself that was ridiculous... And turned into a dead end just to be sure. Predictably, they drove on.

""Of course, no one is following me. That's ridiculous. ...But what if I am?""

I'm trying to get help, but parents have not been forthcoming. I'm petrified of their reaction to telling them that I think I am clinically paranoid. I told them I was depressed, but all I got was some explanation that being a teenager is hard (I'm 17) and that a psychiatrist is for people with mental issues, not you, and that you should try praying more. We're getting a counselor, but we'll see where that goes.

Everything is just going straight to hell. Looking for solace on reddit probably wasn't the best idea, but I'm running out of options.

I can't fall asleep at night before crying my eyes out completely dry. I have fits of anger where I scream at the top of my lungs in despair. The amount of time my own death is on my mind is way too much. I truly don't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy. And much like most people that experience this type of stuff, I'm excellent at hiding it from everyone in my life.

Throwaway/pseudomyns for obvious reasons.  I did not witness the situation described below firsthand, I can only tell you what I've been told by the parties involved.

Recently a family member of mine, Janice, got into a fairly heated argument with another family member, Rachel.  Janice and Rachel don't have the best relationship, but this argument was especially bad for some reason.  At one point in the argument, Janice went into her bedroom and came back out with a loaded revolver and pressed it against her temple, saying that it would be ""so easy"" for her to pull the trigger and asking Rachel if ""this is what (she) want(s).""  There was some back and forth and eventually Janice lowered the gun and went back into her bedroom.

Rachel, obviously upset and worried about Janice's state of mind, called the police.  The responding officers took Janice to the local hospital for evaluation, and the doctors there called us after a few hours and told us that Janice was ""fine"" and that ""she never actually intended to harm herself, she was just trying to make a point.""  Who tries to make a point by putting a gun to their head, I don't know.  The conversation with the doctor only served to make me more upset than I already was.

Since I had basically become the mediating party in the dispute, I obviously removed all the guns and ammunition from Janice's home.  Once Janice was released from her evaluation a few hours later, I picked her up from the hospital.  Janice tried to justify her actions by saying that she didn't know/remember that the revolver was loaded, and that she was just trying to make a point/""shock"" Rachel out of her ""temper-tantrum.""  After some more conversation she finally would admit that putting the gun to her head was a ""stupid decision,"" but she still placed the blame for her doing so on Rachel/Rachel's behavior.

Though I did express my obvious disapproval of her action, I also expressed extreme concern for Janice's mental well-being and urged her to seek therapy as soon as possible.  She constantly and very coldly replied that she was fine and that she didn't need therapy.  Despite everything I said - how much I loved her, how much I just wanted the best for her, and how concerned I was for her well-being - she rebuffed every attempt I made to convince her that she may need help.

So, that's the gist of my situation, /r/mentalhealth.  How can I possibly convince Janice that some sort of therapy could be beneficial for her?  Any and all serious advice is greatly appreciated.

I've never taken a medical leave before, so this is new to me. 

I have been diagnosed in the past with a mood disorder and depression, I have not seen a counselor or doctor in a while, but I'm having a flare up. I've just come off the waiting list for a counselor and meet with thm next month, so basically too late for this situation that has come up. I've called in sick a lot. I've had to leave early because I was about to lose control of my temper. I need to move around a lot and take walks to keep a cool head and even keel. They cracked down on that, they even have people following me into the bathroom because I leave my desk a lot, so now I'm having a hard time keeping myself in check.

I don't know if I have a leg to stand on, but I'd at least like to leave on good terms. I am in pretty bad shape and in poor standing as it is. Lots of lateness and absences. I acted poorly today. My supervisor has had it with me basically. I've been trying to manage without medication because I haven't been able to afford medical care, I've saved up money, so I should be able to afford something on a sliding scale, hopefully. Though without a job, I don't know.

I don't know how I'm going to support myself in between jobs, but I'd like to at least do damage control for my reputation. If I stay I'm concerned what I might do because I'm at the point where I'm having difficulty not losing my temper, I don't want to storm off in a fury and quit or yell at someone or break something.

I know the title was kind of obtuse, but I don't know how else to ask about this experience. I've had it for a long time, and it never stops hurting. I'm actually getting worried that my problem is more severe than I have previously realized, and I definitely don't want to live like this anymore. I've been doing a lot of healing work for the past few years, and it's time to tackle this.

Two things are happening with respect to this paranoia. 

One is that I am constantly imagining that people are watching me, talking about me, laughing at me, judging me. This makes me very angry. I know it's irrational, and I try to just observe the thoughts and not believe them, but often I get very angry because the stress of ""them"" judging me and watching me. I actually feel the way a person would if they really were being judged/watched/mocked, i.e- persecuted 

The second thing is that I am constantly imagining how I would argue against these people watching me, mocking me, and also against people who I imagine would want to tell me how to live, or do anything or say anything to me that is intended to build up their ego. I imagine ex girlfriends, strangers I've had run ins with, anyone who might have a bone to pick with me or vice versa, and then I conjure up this big argument with them. I know this is normal to an extent and everyone does this, but I do it a lot, and it's very stressful. It also makes me feel like a freak unfit for normal human relationships. 

If it helps to understand a bit better, I have OCD and depression, and likely some PTSD from a traumatic surgical event which was blocked from my memory with drugs.

Wasn’t expecting to do a part two on this. but i thought I’d like to explain my experience with treatment and mental health offices. 

Well I’ve been seeing psychiatrist on and off since i was around 10ish, basically i was ordered to see one to be able to stay in the school district i was in. and frankly they didn’t help much. i felt to much was being told to the parents. and well each session felt like:

Folks: Bryan did x
Dr: why did you do x
me: same answer i gave them when i did it


most things i did as a kid i did spur of the moment or i didn’t have a good reason
we never actually talked about what was bothering me. never got down to the actual issue. this lasted till i was out of high school where i never had to go back. then eventually did go back... and well it hasn’t been very good in my opinion.

May just be me being stubborn but alas.

and I’ve learned i don’t kaisers mental health department and how they handle things. i feel more leeway should be made for the mental patients like me. 

first thing about me, i hate calling people, its a major trigger for my anxiety. I actually have to prep my self before i call out. its okay if i can dissociate with my self. Its why if people call me i wont answer but if texted i tend to respond asap. 


so back to the point. 

To make an appointment you have to call in, the mental health department is the only department you cannot make an online appointment. i know why this is something about confidentiality but seriously i don’t make appointments because i don’t want to talk to anyone i just want it over and done with.. i don’t want to tell some stranger about my woes..ill get back to this later...

also I’m not supposed to talk to my psych over the email but fuck i do it anyway. i hate talking on the phone and I’ve said time and time again i rather be comfortable with my mental illness. then with the rules

so that plus the stranger bit i find it easier to talk to people over the internet about my problems i know they aren’t professional but they do the same thing. and sometimes we can bounce things off each other and the works.. however this is never a solution or a way to get medication


medication:
well first thing first.. yes I’ve tried pot and yes it works.. and i would do it more often however i don’t out of respect for the roommates and the whole looking for work thing. 

but well i tried Prozac for a bit then i got the dreaded suicidal thoughts issue.. and this is when my biggest issues started with it
and why i haven’t been back.

I had the issue for a few weeks, hell i often think of suicide but these where becoming worse and worse, so i emailed my psych about it around 4am, i even reassured i wasn’t going to do anything just worried about my mess. and the next morning my phone exploded.. starting at 8am

they have time stamps on the email, and they know I’m not a morning person. so first call i ignore next call ignore... call after call finally around 9am i answer and deal with all of it. turns out the police where called on me. glad they didn’t know where i live... etc etc.. but the worst was dealing with the doctor who prescribe my meds.. when i was trying to explain things all i got was a we take that very seriously etc etc how dare you let us know something we told you to let us know about... so since then i haven’t had an appointment or been on the meds.. I’ve been okay I’ve been thinking of doing group therapy. but again I’ve been up and down.. some days i just want to sit and cry others i feel meh and well others I’m okay.. rarely great it does happen though.

My wife is currently a licensed counselor here in New Jersey / Pennsylvania (UPenn Alum) and we have been talking for awhile on starting a non-profit therapeutic retreat in the South Jersey area and wanted to garner peoples opinion about our ideas/goals. So any honest criticism or questions are more than welcoming.

We want to provide a safe and fun environment to help families connect with each other, improve communication skills, provide parent coaching to help with difficult child behaviors and other therapeutic goals. Sometimes its hard to take a break from this world and work on important family issues. 

Our goal is to have a retreat where each family will be able to lodge in their own place (small cottage/house), fish on the property, animal therapy (horses/rabbits - sister is certified for such things and does wonders) and basically have a place where on-site therapeutic services can be provided and help families in need. 

For the record - I am not a counselor myself but will be involved with day-to-day operations of our intended goal. Any ethical/therapy/etc questions I will direct to my wife. I will also encourage her to create a profile here on reddit so she can provide her professional insight. Before we hit the ground running hard on this, we wanted to try to obtain the general public and fellow colleagues opinion and see how realistic this actually is. 

Here is a link to a survey she created but feel free to throw your 2 cents in how crazy we might be and seek counseling ourselves  :)

I'm not sure if this is the right place to turn to for threads like mine, but I looked long and hard, and this is the best place I could find, so here it goes.

These are my 'problems'. I'm not sure what response I want to get from this, but I just need a place to vent. I know this is going to be EXTREMELY long, but I'd really appreciate it if someone were to read it all and leave a response. I understand if not.

Pictures of me: http://imgur.com/a/UI2Of (Will become relevant when reading through the post.)

Firstly, I'm extremely anxious. When ever I meet someone for the first time (especially girls) I get really nervous and have no idea what to say. I then end up mumbling my words and go extremely red. I'm 19 now and I've never had a girlfriend, due to the fact I find it impossible to approach them. I'm not bad looking, I've been told by people that I'm attractive, but my confidence holds me back. I think the main reason for this is that I have a lisp, which sucks, and I'm super embarrassed about it. Also, in my head, whenever I'm speaking to someone, or speaking in front of a group, I see myself as the 15 year old version of myself, who wore ugly glasses, had braces, horrible long hair, wore horrible clothes and was downright ugly. I'm not that person anymore, I know I'm not, but I just can't get that image of myself out of my head. The sad/funny thing is, I always act in front of my friends that I'm not nervous. I make myself out to be a guy that never gets embarrassed and can talk to anyone. I even openly tell them sometimes ""I never get embarrassed!"" And if one of my friends feels nervous I say ""why be nervous, just get on with it!"", or something along those lines. The truth is, I'm as nervous as anyone one of them, maybe even worse.

Next on the list links to the way I see myself and my appearance. As I said in the last paragraph, I've been told numerous times by people that I'm not ugly, and some days, I agree with them. I look at myself as think, ""Wow, how do I not have a girlfriend when I look like this? I look good!"" (I'm not arrogant, I promise.) Then after a couple days of thinking this, I'll look at myself and think the complete opposite!? How can my opinion of myself so greatly differ from one day to the next? Like I also said, when speaking to people who I'm nervous about speaking to, I see myself as 15 year old me, who DEFINITELY wasn't attractive. I'm so conscious about my appearance that it's not healthy. I'll spend ages in the morning making sure I look my best (which maybe isn't such a bad thing), but then on the days where I think I look ugly, NOTHING can change that. I'll get so frustrated, then make threads on a different subreddit, asking people if I'm attractive for a cheap confidence booster. But like I just said, on those days where I think I look ugly (50% of the time), no matter how many people tell me otherwise, I won't change my mind.

Next is my OCD. I know the term 'OCD' is thrown around a lot these days, and everyone thinks they have some form of it, but I think mine might be kinda serious. I'm not like it ALL of the time, but a majority of the time I am, especially when I'm nervous or feel down (a majority of the time!) I feel the need to touch everything twice, once with each hand. If I touch it with one hand differently than I did with the other, then I have to repeat the process. I'm embarrassed even talking about this, and it's not something I'm proud of. On top of that, I have to double/triple check EVERYTHING! The lights, the taps, the windows. I have to make sure every door in my house is closed before I go to bed. Then of course there's the 'usual stuff' like making sure the volume on my car radio, TV, etc, is on an even number or multiple of 5, and making sure everything is straight/in a line. This isn't the most serious issue with me, but it can get extremely annoying when, on my worst days, I spend around half an hour double/triple checking EVERYTHING in my house before I go to bed.

Concentration is also a big thing for me. I can't concentrate, especially when I'm writing. I LOVE writing, especially about sport, but I can't go more than five minutes or so without clicking onto YouTube, etc (you can't imagine how long it's taking me to write this...). I also get REALLY frustrated REALLY fast. Just two 'small things' I guess, but I just wanted to include them.

Next on my 'list' is how paranoid I get. Whenever I hear someone laughing, or talking, or two of my friends speak privately, 9 times out 10, I'll automatically assume it's about me. It's a horrible, horrible feeling, one that I know isn't justified 99% of the time. Whenever I get invited to parties or to go out, I feel like I've only been invited so I can be made fun of and be made the 'star of the joke' by my friends. This links back to me seeing myself as this ugly 15 year old, who had reasons to be picked on. Let me make something clear. NOTHING justifies a person to be picked on/bullied, but what I'm trying to say is that a few years ago, I was definitely an easy target. Thankfully I wasn't bullied much, if at all back then. But yeah, it sucks. Most of the time I don't go out, out of fear that everyone there will turn on me and start picking me apart and talking about me. I hate it.

Jealousy is also a big issue for me. Everyone feels jealousy sometime in their life, but for me it's unjustified. IF I had a girlfriend who was out with another guy, while I was at home, then yes, I'd have a right to be jealous. But it's not that. When I see my friends out, having fun, I get extremely jealous and then depressed. This contradicts my earlier paragraph about being too paranoid to go out. It's a vicious circle. Just to make something else clear. I'm not a total recluse. I do go out to University, etc, and sometimes go to the cinema, have a meal with my closest friends, but it's very rare they want to meet up and do anything. It's mainly people who I don't really know, or new people, that I'm afraid will pick of me when I'm out in public. This links back to me being extremely anxious/self conscious and the seeing myself as a 15 year old. But anyway, moving on.

Finally, and arguably the most important/worst thing about me and the way I feel/act is my 'depression'. I'm cautious to self diagnose myself as 'depressed', as it's another term that's used far too frequently, similar to OCD. I'm more inclined to believe I suffer from a mild form of bipolar. Let me explain. Some days, I'm fine. I'll be happy, I want to go and do things and be around other people, I enjoy my hobbies, and I feel great. Then something will just change in my head, and I'll be a different person. It's not to the extent of say schizophrenia, but I just won't be happy, at all. I want to be alone, in my room, by myself. I don't want to talk to or see my family or friends, I just want to lay down in bed, listening to music, thinking about things. It's really strange and horrible. I've researched bipolar disorder quite extensively and have noticed that it's usually categorised as long periods of feeling happy, followed by long periods of depression, then repeated. Mine is like that, in the sense that it goes in cycles, but it's usually every few days, not months. I've noticed this for about three years now, and I since then, I don't think I've ever gone through an entire month, or even a full week of feeling completely happy, or completely depressed. If anyone is reading this, then you may be thinking it's typical teenage mood swings, but it's different than that. When I'm depressed, for the next few days I feel absolutely awful and lose interest in everything I usually love (football, gaming, television shows) and just want to do nothing and be around no-one. I hate it. I've never considered suicide, thankfully, which I suppose is the silver lining to it all, but that doesn't detract away from how shitty I feel. I can't really pinpoint the reason for my 'depression', but it's more than likely a build-up of all my 'problems' that I listed above. The main one being that I've never had a girlfriend. It may seem like a petty thing, but I just wish I had someone who I loved and who loved me back. Obviously I have my family, but it's different. I just want someone to talk to, and go places with, share experiences with. I have a couple close friends, but they rarely want to do anything and I only ever really see them during classes at University. I just checked my phone and the only person I've text in the last two weeks is my brother. I'm 19, and I only really speak to my brother?! I love the fact me and him are so close, but I should have a better social life than this. I've now finished Uni for four months, and I doubt I'll leave the house very much, due to the fact I don't really have anyone to do anything with! This adds to my feeling of 'depression'.

So yeah, there we have it. My 'problems' (or at least those I can think of as of right now) listed in a Reddit thread. Even if nobody reads this, it was great to write down what's going on inside my head, for the first time ever.

I'm 19 years old and am finishing up my first year of college and it has easily been the worst year of my life. I moved to a city 2 and a half hours away from my hometown to attend community college. I live in an apartment by myself and didn't know anyone in the city. Prior to moving, I was excited and looking forward to moving out and starting a new chapter of my life with  new city to explore. I had always disliked my city and wanted to move out of my parents house, and I didn't want a roommate and was looking forward to living on my own (I'm an only child), so there were no negative feelings before I moved.



A week after I moved I had a sort of breakdown and became very sad. I talked to my mom about it and we figured it was just normal feelings of homesickness and fear that every college freshman feels after moving out, and that the first month or so  would be the worst and that it would get better over time. So I joined clubs, went to meetups, went to study groups, talked to people in my classes, and want through all the motions of trying to make friends, except I didn't make any. There is a group of people in one of my classes who I made friends with, but we only hung out once outside of school. I have a couple of their phone numbers but we don't text. They're nice, great people but I don't feel the chemistry is there. There are people at school who I talk to, but thats it. I've tried to make plans to hang out with some of these people but got flaked on, and I'm always the one to text them and reach out to them, they never seem to put any effort in. I feel theres no point wasting my time on people who have no interest in getting to know me. 


The only person I hang out with is my boyfriend. He lives and hour and a half away so I only see him on the weekends. I visit back home about once a month, and my friends have only came to visit me a couple of times.
 

So now it's 3 weeks until the end of the year and I have no one I can call a friend, only acquaintances who don't want to further our friendship, and I'm miserable. This has been affecting me in extremely negative ways. This is where I have a hard time explaining everything so please bare with me. In addition to feeling down and crying all the time, I have become more anxious. I find myself worrying about everything. I went to Boston and for months before the trip I was convinced the plane was going to crash, every time I drive on the freeway I'm scared I'm going to get in a accident, I'm worried my boyfriend is cheating on me, I worry about my apartment catching on fire, my parents and boyfriend dying, really ridiculous things that I should not be worrying about and hadn't worried about prior to all this. It's driving my crazy. 


My self-esteem has also been affected. For about a year in high school, I had extremely low self-esteem to the point where I tried to starve myself. I was eating 500-900 calories a day and was making myself vomit. I never talked to anyone about it and never had any professional help, but I overcame it and my confidence had gone up tremendously. I was doing great when I moved, but now I feel myself moving back towards that. My insecurities and past feelings of low self-esteem have been coming back and I fear I may regress back to my body-dysmorphic tendencies. 


I also worry this will start to affect my relationship with my boyfriend. Since I don't have any friends and I'm constantly sad, I always want to be with my boyfriend. The only time I really feel happy is when I'm with my boyfriend. I know is not ok or healthy for me or for him. I've never looked for happiness in someone else and I know I can't rely on a another person to make me happy, so these feelings are very disturbing to me. 


I don't want to move back home, but I've been considering it. The only reason I have for moving back home would be my friends. I wrote out the pros and cons of moving back and the cons seemed to outweigh the pros, but I know I can't take another year of this. 


 I was never a sad person and always tried to maintain a positive and optimistic outlook. I had had my ups and downs before, but I was always content and happy. But this year has been filled with me crying and feeling almost hopeless. I'm lonely, miserable, and no longer excited for anything. I'm not looking forward to going back home for the summer. I'm going to a music festival with my boyfriend and best friend in a couple of weeks and am going to Italy next month and am not excited for either one. I haven't felt like my normal self for months and wish I could have my old personality back. I'm extremely lost and have no idea how to handle this or what to do. My positive thinking is not enough to overcome this. I plan on making a counseling appointment for next week. In the mean time, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,First year of college has been the worst time of my life

Smoking and mental disorders have quite a bit in common -despite one being a chosen habit-; both have high mortality rates, and approximately 20% of people in the United States and the United Kingdom smoke, which is about the same percentage of people with mental illness.

After looking at data on 1.7 million patients and from 20 recent scientific reviews and studies, the researchers identified more than 250,000 deaths related to mental health problems, substance and alcohol abuse, dementia, autistic spectrum disorders, learning disability and childhood behavioral disorders, and found that the risk of mortality for women with postpartum depression is more than 7 times higher than that of a person who smokes heavily.

Furthermore, people with anorexia and substance abuse disorders also have higher mortality rates than smokers. That is not to say that smokers have it good, only that the mentally ill have it worse. Chain smokers tend to die 8-10 years earlier than non-smokers, but that is still 10 extra years as compared to schizophrenics, whose life expectancy may be reduced by up to two decades.

My good friend has been suffering from low self-esteem for about 10 years now. Not that she was super confident before but it's just gotten worse the last few years. It's resulted in her staying in a demeaning job, demeaning relationship, and poor physical health. Believe me when I say I've tried EVERYTHING - from helping her with her resume, trying to introduce her to new people, and getting her to be active with me. It all comes back to her not feeling confident enough to leave her job, leave toxic relationships, or leave the house to go exercise (even walk) with me. 

I've tried to suggest she see a therapist but she maintains she doesn't have a problem - i.e. ""I'm not depressed, I don't need a therapist."" Anyway, therapy only works if it's what she wants. She lacks the motivation to improve her life situation, she says she'll do this or that - go to school, get a gym membership - which she does for a while then quits.

The thing is I don't really have any severe issues, and in the past that has always deterred me from ever seeing anyone.


I have some mild depression/anxiety but nothing that prevents me from functioning day to day. I could be so much more though, if I could only get past some insecurities and fears that I have. So I want to find someone I can talk to that can help me through these issues.

It's been pretty bad since I began college, but I didn't get help until last summer (a couple weeks before my third year). I started on Zoloft, went up on dosage, but was taken off after tummy troubles. Went on Prozac, did nothing for me. Now I am on Venlafaxine. Started on one 75mg pill, went to 2, then 3. So I've been on it for roughly a semester, maybe a bit less.

This medicine has definitely helped. My energy is way up from what it was and my social anxiety has improved. My perfectionism/anxiety surrounding school work has not been helped a whole lot and I have headaches a lot of the time.

The one thing that really bothers me is what happens when I skip it. I will accidentally miss it or intentionally miss it (so I can drink some without worrying). A couple of times I have ended up without for 2 or 3 days and some emotions seem heightened. Sad stories, happy stories, or even some songs that I really like will make me teary and emotional. It's not an absurd reaction, but not reactions that I've had lately. I'm worried that the meds are suppressing other emotions. Is this possible or am I over-analyzing things? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Or is this just something anti-depressants (or just SNRIs) do?

I've gone back down to 2 on my own recently since I am not in school and because I am worried and I've been notably more tired and anxious, but fewe headaches (thus far). Should I go back to 3 or am I onto something? (I know this is more of a dr question but the person I use is at the university and unless you take summer classes, you can't use the facilities) I'd like to not rely on medicine anyways (I went on meds because I felt like I couldn't fix myself and I'm not quite sure I can now, but I'm willing to let myself try more) so I'd want to go down on it anyways.

For an example of our topics, here is the link about our chat tomorrow on Twitter at 9pm CST: https://spsmchat.wordpress.com/2014/05/31/drphilrodgers-discusses-empirical-findings-for-suicide-prevention-and-socialmedia-with-spsm-sunday/

But the truth is that suicide is a major public health issue, and there's so much misinformation, lack of information, and stigma about it that we need to spread this expertise to a bigger audience. This is hard for the mental health field. Digital media is pretty anxiety-provoking for us. Most psychologists and researchers who study suicide are frightened of venues like Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit. And, for the tiny minority of Suicidologists researching social media, almost none of them actually use social media themselves. There is a big lack of insight here.

I read Reddit posts on suicide all of the time. They often make the front page. It shames me that the Suicidology community has chosen to be absent from these conversations, even though we have a lot we could contribute.

I believe I can talk the President of the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) into an AMA...but only if there is real interest in AMAs on suicide. The AAS just opened a new division for people with lived experience of suicide attempts...and they have a lot to talk about as well.

Redditors, what do you think?

If I do learn about an event in which others suffered significantly and/or died in something worse than a ""normal"" old-age death, I become very disturbed, and it often lasts for about 48 hours. For this reason, I don't take in almost *any* news, since it is always loaded with tragic/disturbing/horrifying information, and everyone I know has been asked to avoid mentioning anything like this to me.  I lock down my use of the internet in a rather contrived way to try to avoid this type of information (I use Reddit and all other websites carefully). I am even also susceptible to being highly disturbed by *fictional* suffering, and strictly avoid films or books where that kind of gory/twisted content is present.

But it doesn't work perfectly. I occasionally learn of something anyway. Yesterday a friend slipped and casually mentioned something very upsetting that happened more than 20 years ago to someone that I not only didn't know but had only just learned about one sentence before...and it sent me into 24 hrs or more of recurrent bouts of anguish about it (both over the event itself and that he slipped and told me). I'm in the midst of it now, actually.

Because it is affecting my happiness, productivity, and relationships, as well as it makes *me* suffer greatly, I'm seeking suggestions for how, if possible, I can reduce my emotional reaction to these events. I'd also like to know if there is a name for this type of condition, what sorts of therapy might be most helpful, if there are any sort of ""support groups"" out there for it, and basically learn of everything I can do to reduce this problem in my life. I read through one book, *Living with Intensity* about ""overly excitable"" children and adults who are extremely sensitive and although that was intriguing, and didn't do much for *helping* me. I do qualify as a sensitive person, and am greatly disturbed by acoustic noise, fidgeting, am easily annoyed, etc. I mention that in case it makes any connections for you.

Before you start thinking that I hear voices telling me what to do, thats not the case haha... 

Let me try and describe this the best I can. First off, You can talk out loud in your mind.. sort of when your are typing and you are pronouncing each word in your head as you type it. 

Then there is somthing that I have heard reffered to as the ""track of the day"" sort of that feint endless loop of songs playing in the back of your mind, this is seperate from your consious thought, these are not songs that you are singing in your head, but just sort of on auto play and get drowned out into the background as you start to consiously think of words or talking in your mind... So im guessing it would be subconsious thought right? 

Well aside from hearing music in my subconsious, or people singing... I always get random people talking.. Not like they are talking to me, or even making sense at all, but just like randomly when i was typing another post and editing it.. I got a feint voice that almost felt like it was in the back of my head, and it sounded like my mom talking in a muffled voice saying something about picking up a hot dog. 

The tone of it, or its location, could be best described as when you get a ringing in your ears.. Its just like that, but instead of ringing, its random voices..  and its not all the time, again, it just happens about the same amount of time that a ringing ear would occur. 

Does this mean I am hearing voices and I am crazy? lol

I want to be a fashion designer but I feel unmotivated and like I don't have what it takes to put non the work. Sometimes I think I just want to go suger daddy to suger daddy until I find the richest one and marry them. It really makes me des pressed that I'm not a rich little spoilt brat. 
      I also ten feel really guilty that people are dying and that they would do anything for someone to me is nothing and that makes me really sad and like I'm wrong and I feel guilty about feeling guilty. I cry myself to sleep most nights which is a sad thing for some my age (teenager) I've always just blamed it on hormones and stuff and honestly don't think it's other than hormones and stress. I feel like I've failed all my GCSEs and that I'm a lost cause. I'm gay, which I thought might be worth mentioning and for a while I thought it might be me deep down feeling inadequate and insecure about that but I honestly don't feel anything about that and know all my family would accept me and stuff which is a really refreshing Thing To feel I suppose but I don't know anymore. I'm awkward and weird and have a hard time even booking myself a hair cut. I have no friends and don't know if I want any. I feel like I nee to just get through school and don't need friends and that after school I can move, get a job, good friends and that where as in school you kind f HAVE to be surrounded by those people but I feel lost. Like ill amount to motif after school and that my life will be even sadder when I'm older. 
      I constantly feel like I'm being judged and I'm a little scared of being judged. I also feel like I want to just act like myself and just not care about having friends and kiking and just get through or if anything plan my life and get my life ready. I also stay friends with people who's personality I hate and people who have done things that I against everything I believe in but we make each other laugh and despite the fact it's a hollow friendship and that I honestly don't care about her and vide versa I think of it as a pass time. Rather than being bored in class. I feel like nobody knows me and nobody will ever know me. I'm really attention seeking despite being awkward and anxious which is really strange. You can get everything in life my being good looking and I used to think I was good looking but I don't know anymore. I'm a really bad person too. Sometimes I make fun of people and are really mean, not because I'm obscure or because I'm coping with anything. I just do it because it's funny. I find it funny. It's no too bad I don't make people sad or cry but it's selfish. I want to try and just be a good person. But again I don't feel motivate to change my life. I also really love beauty and health so I'm thinking finally making myself healthy and using beauty stuff I will not only be keeping myself busy like a hobby, I'll be making me look better but I also feel like it (although it ls hard for me in itself) it will help me change my life. I honestly don't feel that sad all the time. Most of the times I'm quite happy and cheery but when I start getting sad and nippy it's really sad. I definitely don't have Bi polar disorder because it's not like its mood swings or like totally out of my control depression them suddenly happy. 
          I also want to talk about something else. If I've even posted this in the right place.  I don't know how to use reddit. But I have this friend. And she said she got raped and got pregnant and then got pushed down stairs and stuff and unfortunately her baby died. (All of this in her old school). She self harm and goes to counselling. (Also I smoked with her for a while). I felt really bad for her and tried my best to look after her and give her my support and she was like a sister. We would get into scrapes but we were always confident and comfortable with each other. A while ago before the holidays she's told us that she's going to meet a 24(I think) year old in her old town and that they were going to smoke and have sex and stuff. She's bragged and badgered to everyone constantly how she was going to see him on Monday and I old her that he's a fat weirdo chatting up underard girls online to come have sex with him and she just said all she wants is sex and smokes and that he's on a give him that (it weren't quite that dramatic but you get the idea) and where I am underage people have sex all the time. I'm in the Chavy school (everywhere is scabby where I am). It not much of a big deal to people. People who've had NOTHNG wrong happen do it because it's fun and they like it. I initially thought because of her rape that she might be seeking danger or just sex but she weren't doing anything weird. Again when we get back after the holidays she's happy and content and says she smoked had sex and that she loved it. I said if it's something about the rape and the baby and she convince me it weren't. A few days later she acts all depressed and you could tell it was fake she didn't even try. She then says not to talk about him because he raped him. I said that she wante to hook up with him before she did and had to. I said that she was happy before and after and she said she was raped and didn't want to talk about it because she was scared. I accepts that as a thin and comforted her. I then heard her say when we were talking that her mom found the texts and the conversation and that her mom asked her about it an that she told her mom it was rape and he never wanted to do it. Obviously her mom called police and stuff she had gone through it before, she sorted all the police reports and stuff out. I then realised she was lying she panicked didn't want to get in trouble so called rape. I don't wan to go into detail but we were talking about the incident before that and she told her story different than before I started picking holes without doing it on purpose and she basically spelled it out for me that she had sex because she wanted to, she got pregnant, found out and then told her mom she was raped so that when the bump showed it would be obvious it was from the rape. All the stories like her gettin pushed down the stairs were pulled from her ass and that she had been scratching her skin so it looked like she had deep self harm scars but she just did it for the story. Her baby died because she didn't want to keep and but didn't want to tarnish he name with an abortion so she smoked and drunk to kill it. Everyone a new boy moves to my school she acts sad lies, flaunts her scars and stuff so they feel sorry for her and give her attention. I initially wanted to help her and try and get her to realise she doesn't need to lie and cheat to get what she wants. She could apply the attention that she needs and do something. She had a boyfriend once who she got from doing her gig and then flirts and tries to he other guys and acts all ute and innocent. I typed this whole thing out to ask whether or not I'm crazy for hating her. I'm not angry or going through a phase. I HATE her. If she were to die I would not be at a loss. She's manipulated me. She's a fat ugly cow who thinks she's pretty. I think it's somewhat out of jealousy that she gets away with it and get attention for lying and cheating. It's also just that I hate her. We continue to act friends even though we hate each other. (Not see if she hates me but I don't care). But I sit next to he in most classes and don't want other to confront me and indont want to make a scene. It's just shade throwing constantly. We laugh and entertain each other and I suppose we can get along but I hate her guts. I'm pretty much using her to add to my list of friends because I don't have a lot. It's not healthy and need to get her out of my life. 
       With that story and the stuff I said before. I just need words. I need to know what to do. I feel lost and need someone's advice. I really don't want to talk to other friends and family because it's awkward and not easy to talk about and that would put more stress on me. I feel like an awefulboerson. I don't want to kill myself or die as much. But I don't want to be here. I just wish I weren't born. I would never kill myself or danger myself in anyway. But I just don't want to be alive.

I'll start by saying I do believe he drinks a lot. I'm not sure exactly how much, and I'm pretty sure this has been a problem while he was sober as well (It's pretty obvious when he's drunk).

Basically, he doesn't remember anything. He doesn't remember to do things, and he doesn't remember conversations he has had. I'll name just a few examples, but these are just a few instances out of many:

-We were going on a trip, and I needed him to stop by my parents' house to pick up an air mattress. I had already left and he was leaving about 6 hours later. I texted him to make the request, and he said that was fine, but I would have to ""remind"" him. When I spoke to him later, I reminded him to stop by my parents' house. He then proceeded to ask why he had to stop at my parents' house.

-My brother told him about a potential new signing with their favourite soccer team (which he follows very closely). He said ""I haven't heard anything about that guy"", and my brother proceeded to tell him about the guy for about 10 minutes. The very next day, my brother told him ""looks like the deal has been finalized for *player*"". My friend replied, again, ""I haven't heard anything about that guy"".

It's hard to sit and come up with a list, but he CONSTANTLY tells me things 2-3 times. It's really weird because he always words it the exact same and I get a funny feeling and try not to laugh at him. Does he really not remember saying that nearly identical set of sentences to me several hours or days ago?

At this point, this type of thing is happening so frequently that I really am getting a bit worried.

To give some context for my issue, I have been binge drinking every Saturday night for over a month.

If I feel that something is not right, (e.g. friend says or does something that usually doesn't happen or a general event that is strange and doesn't usually happen) it eats at me, giving me anxiety attacks that make me feel like my life isn't real. I tend to sleep every opportunity I get as these symptoms are frustrating to deal with. It is now 9 days since the symptoms started and they were no longer present after 7 days. I do not get any strong suicidal thoughts.

This has happened 4-5 times before and has lasted between 3-7 days and afterwards I feel strange that it happened but completely normal. Note that it doesn't relate to how often I drink as I've gotten it from an isolated night of binge drinking and not got it from binge drinking for almost a week straight.

Shortly after hitting puberty I developed what's likely psychotic depression, but could be schizoaffective disorder or full-blown schizophrenia. I don't know. Mild PTSD, too - I had a short episode today when some kid popped a bag, partly what motivated this post.

My disorder has forced me into a bit of an academic corner, unfortunately. I've disregarded my grades, maybe subconsciously hoping a teacher would notice and try to help. I'm a strong student otherwise and have been somewhat frustratingly singled out for it. See, I can't tell anyone about this. I just can't. I'm afraid of my parents - they're by no means abusive and are incredibly supportive, but I speak on average three words to them per week. Every time I'm on the verge of telling them, or someone else, it's like I hit a sort of forcefield of corrupt willpower. The only thing I can do is drop hints. I've consciously stepped up my erratic behavior in front of everyone I know, but it hasn't gotten me anywhere. Nobody seems to notice.
 
I haven't worried much - about anything - for the past 3 or 4 years. I've been completely detached from school, family, reality. I've just been living one day to the next, doing whatever I need to to make myself content and dodge the melancholia a while longer. It's not a permanent solution. With my disorder, I feel very strongly about things. One such thing is academics. Something knocked me out of my trance today, if only for a moment, and I noticed there's no way in hell I can get into my ideal college with my current status. I'm currently going through a bit of a manic episode, and I know that, by ignoring the problem as I always do, it will only be worse come the end of senior year. I fear I might do something stupid - or dangerous.

Again: I need help. How do I get it, when I have an unseen force seeming to forbid it?

Really, just a bit of motivation is valuable at this point. I can technically improve my grades drastically with a few right moves, but my mind's just so boggled at the moment.

Thank you for reading - just writing this makes me feel slightly better.

I am 28, and I got sick with a sever case of crohns disease that has left me stuck in bed for the last 2 years, with no sign of a normal working life anytime soon. 

I want to start some sort of home based business, but not as extreme as something that I will need to be working on and on the phone constantly (To start) just like buying things from overseas and selling them on ebay or craigslist. Where I can work at my own pace to make some money. 

Something like that, I just don't know all the different things out there that I could look into doing, so I am posting here to maybe get some ideas. 

I can add more details as I reply to comments to get more specific, I just dont want to make this post way too long so that people dont end up reading it. 


One of the things I was also thinking about was figuring out if it was possible to make money by posting up my own little write-ups and articles online?  I have noticed that over the course of the last few years that I have become pretty good at typing lot of interesting content in forums, posts always being wayyy to long, but fun to read. Obviously I would need to maybe take a writing class at the local college if I can muster the energy and work on my grammar etc..

 However, Are there any options for starting a blog or something as to where I an just post up random things that I am thinking about week to week talking about anything and everything?  I know NOTHING about this, what it would take, how to make money from it, or where to start.

I guess that's how I convince myself that I'm right most of the times because I got this inflated thought about myself, not on a douche bag sort of way but as in I know what I'm capable of I show it to myself on a daily basis as with the things I do and how I approach my relationships with the world, I'm good, not in the best way though I have through my entire life made it my mission to have shallow relationships with everyone.

I was born a second son from a family of four and I love each and everyone of them. I was always the smiling one because my older brother and I are closest of age, I got a 8 year gap between me and my sister. So I was like the polar opposite of my brother, I got that natural ability to get along with people and have people get along with me and over the years I have learned to manipulate that to my advantage.

While in school I was skinny until like fourth grade then I started getting fat and fatter over the years, and I have never really been like the one to play outside I always had my group of friends come over to my house and we play super nintendo and as time passed the nintendo 64, I was never really harassed during school I was very loved by my teachers and friends but its only because I knew what to say when to smile and such, but I looked in the mirror and the reflection image I got every day made me sad. Over the years my brother started calling me ""fat"" or ""fatty"" but he said it with such a tone, just enough to make me feel loved when he said that even though he was making fun of me.
It hurt my self-stem I have always had female friends but even though I liked one of them I never have the courage or self love to express it. Once, on the last days of middle school I decided I did not want to be fat anymore so I started reading anything I could gaze upon about nutrition and exercise I loved the subject and on those summer vacations I lost around 30 pounds (around 14 kilograms), but the inner me never lost that weight, I carried myself on high school the same way, only people would now actually look at me instead of me looking for them, and just there I found out about one of the only truths in human mentality; we are not all equal. People began to treat me good because of how I looked, and I knew that because there is a clear difference between having a conversation and making someone laugh with something you say when you are wearing a 160lbs body frame on a 13 year old and that same weight only just 12% of body fat at 18 years old. I always loved girls but never really had a girl friend and the longing for it made me picture and imagine my perfect relationship, years went by people came in my life and people left my life like it was nothing so I started treating it like nothing, I mean I don't really have much interest outside my personal hobbies which haven't changed much since I was a little kid, but when I like something new I obsess all over it. So a new friend came and I loved that person deeply then said person left, and it happened all over again, it kept happening and I kept getting all sad over it until I started growing indifferent, aphatic. I was sinical and I still am when it comes to inter-human interaction.

Years have gone by and on my second year of college I had my first girlfriend and I did everything I said I would do, I put my ""perfect relationship"" idea I created on my head since I was younger and it was the best of times I have ever had, but on the day we where moving in together just because: Hey we are young, we love each other and the rent price will go hell down.

On that very day she broke up with me on my apartment bedroom I was packing up, she said, she still loved her ex-boyfriend and recently got in touch again so they where going to give it another shot. People leave right? They sure do and I am an expert at letting go, but it did broke me inside for like 1 year. And just this past september I met a girl she is amazing, probably the most amazing girl I have ever met, maybe I think that because in her own way she is just as damaged as I am, fuck I love that girl but she has a boyfriend and I don't know at which point of my life I decided it was okay to date her while she had a boyfriend but we did, she said she was to break it off because since the start of their relationship he a lot times harasses her verbally and I have been witness to it. But I kept on trying, waiting patiently and it never came, just the monthly ""don't forget about me date"" up until like 6 weeks I decided for my own good to part ways, and we didn't talk at all until last friday she called me to check how I was and I exploded on her, not on a violent way, but as in I poured out everything I had on my head it was a really bittersweet conversation because I had never been so exposed before I never really opened myself in such way; after the conversation she apologized for the damage she did to me and we talked about trying this time, for real... for once.

She didn´t really damaged me because I am so detached from the deeply emotional me since I was younger, as I stated I had always thought about myself with such an inflated look, but recently I have begun to look at me on a critic level, analyze my past actions and thoughts as well as the present ones and how I drive myself.

I definitely have a fear of intimacy and a feeling inadequacy, like I'm not good enough for a committed relationship and make no effort to start one with girls. I get the distinct feeling that I'm not someone that should be taken seriously by others, that I lack some kind of depth of character or level of maturity that people will pick up on upon closer inspection. The result is that I have basically withdrawn myself from dating altogether by not making any effort to form relationships with girls. I am very well-spoken, and pretty intelligent, and many people say they admire the way I carry myself and express myself. Still, it does not make me feel like a real, worthwhile person. I am physically attractive, although knowing this and receiving a wealth of (unsolicited) confirmations from people has not helped my self esteem. Girls send very obvious hints to me all the time and express interest, hoping I will make a move, and despite knowing this I still lack the confidence to do anything. Whenever an obvious opportunity opens up to connect with a girl, I abruptly close it. If I am being introduced to an interested girl through a mutual friend, I will simply say hi and then try to visibly show I am not interested. If I catch a girl staring or constantly looking over, I will make sure not to smile, and give off a cold vibe. God forbid they muster up the courage to smile at me, I'll just look away. At the end of the day I'm lonely and miserable and I did it to myself, and I can't figure out why I feel the need to act this way. I'm throwing away the best years of my life and countless potentially beautiful moments and relationships.

I am now convinced these are all symptoms of a severe failure to form an identity, and I will be unable to live a fulfilling, normal life till I resolve this. Any idea where to start?

Symptoms:
* Difficulty sleeping
* Oversleeping/constantly tired
* Nightmares every night
* Lack of enjoyment of pretty much anything except food (I comfort eat)
* Extreme inability to concentrate/ excessive procrastionation (I can't work on anything pretty much, it takes me a week to complete a five minute task)
* Reduced intelligence (if that's a thing)
* Short and long term memory loss
* Fidgeting/restless leg
* Nail/skin biting

I've been diagnosed with (on separate occasions) anxiety, social anxiety, depression and most recently adult ADHD.

I've been prescribed pregabalin, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, mertazapine, propanolol, zoplicone with very little success. Not at the same time obviously!

Things are really bad right now.  I opened up to someone for the first time in a long time—an ex girlfriend—thinking that we could get back together.  She seems interested but she dropped it on me that she lives with a physically and emotionally abusive ex boyfriend.  She stayed with me for a week and we had a plan to call the cops, but at the end she was convinced by this asshole to let him stay there until he gets back on his feet.

So I'm going mad.  I have issues with feeling unloved by my SOs, and I get really anxious when I can't get a hold of them if I think that they might be in trouble, or might be leaving me, etc etc. 

I went and did a mental health eval but I won't have my first appointment until the 16th, and I don't know how the fuck I'm going to make it until then.  I'm just crying randomly and feel so dead and angry and broken inside.  I don't have a diagnosis so I don't know what kind of coping mechanisms I need.

 My mother is out of control, on multiple occasions she'll go on rant and start raving about things. She'll yell, scream, slam doors, and break things like she's a 5 year old who was told she couldn't have candy before dinner.

On one occasion she started yelling at me because over memorial day weekend my father spent about $300 on one day and how that was money for groceries, Most of the money WAS spent on groceries. She yelled and screamed at me like it was my fault and then she left the room for about 20 minutes before she came back asking; ""What do you want for dinner?"" like nothing ever happened.

She doesn't just do this to us, when she gets even the slightest bit angry she'll take it out on the closet living thing. We got a puppy in December and she's about 7 months old now, this morning my mother caught the dog chewing on an extra piece of carpeting we have left over since we redid the carpet in the living room. She didn't know i could hear her but she started flipping her shit. She yelled at the dog calling her a little piece of shit, saying that she'd wish the dog would die, Saying that she hated her, etc.

It's not just that either, when she's not at work all she does is sit on her ass playing shitty Facebook games and watching TV. She works as a manager 5 min away from our home for 9-10 hours a day, meanwhile my father works an hour away from home and for 12 hours a day(So you don't have to do math, that's 14 hours he's not at home, the time he is home he's either sleeping or helping me with house work. She never does any of the work around the house. yet she still has the boulders to complain when it's dirty around the house or when there's clothes washed because she just throws them around the room like she's a 15-year-old.

Along with all that, we try to mention any thing about it its our fault or we hate her or ""her opinion doesn't f***ing matter to anyone."" According to her, nothings ever her fault and she's never wrong. In the 18 years I've lived with my parents, I've NEVER heard her say ""I'm sorry."" or ""I was wrong."" or even ""You were right.""

Part of this was cathartic, the other part is trying to find out if there's a way we can help her. The only people she'll listen to is her parents so, as bad as it might be, we're going to tell them about it in hopes that they will be able to convince her to go to therapy or to take medication that will help her. We can't keep going on like this. If nothing gets better, both me and my father agree she'll have to deal with it by herself without us. Because if we get yelled at one last time for not doing ""Our share of the housework."" We're just going to take our stuff and leave her to deal with her madness by herself.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I need help with this problem, i don't know how long i can deal with this."

I felt so sore that I stayed in bed for most of the day, and when I could muster myself up, I just propped myself onto the chair beside my bed and stood there staring aimlessly just trying to recollect and make sense of what had happened last night. All I remember is leaving my residence area (situated beside the university) to go out for some drinks at a pub. It was just a random thing I felt like doing after binge studying for most of the last week and a half. I would have just gone out to a bottle shop and back but my place has a strict no alcohol allowed policy and I didn't want to take my chances and end up being disappointed, so I thought what's the harm in going out for a few drinks, an hour or two and then back. I must've left around 10+. I made small talk with a few people here and there and right round the hour mark, when I started feeling a little high, I hit off with these two other guys, who couldn't have been more than 4,5 years older. There was also a couple a their table but they came and went regularly. Anyway, at one point when they were all there, they told me it was my turn to pay for drinks. They had paid for the earlier round, and despite me insisting that I wanted to go Dutch, they chided me and said C'mon we're pals and stuff so I just went along in the heat of things. When they expected me to do the same later on, I thought these guys are crazy,  I didn't mind buying one or even two, but for the whole gang, no way they were taking advantage so I respectfully declined citing stuff like I was a student and I needed to keeps tight leash on the cash I had. It was awkward for a while but they soon laughed it off but I thought maybe I should make a move. The couple left awhile later and I used that as a way to make my exit. The other two offered to walk me over to a decent taxi waiting area since there were so many pubs/clubs etc along the street, it would be hard to pinpoint it to the taxi coming to pick you up. This kind of camaraderie over a few drinks was normal back when I was in Tasmania, so the alarm bells in my head didn't go ringing but halfway through they kicked me and elbowed me from behind and caught me as slooped down. It must've looked like a drunkard getting help from his pals cos nobody stepped in when I started making noises. They took me to some alleyway and started beating the shit out of me, and I must've passed out briefly cos when next thing I remember I was down on the ground, no idea where my glasses were. The pain wasn't that apparent at that time, I guess my body was numb but I was pretty relieved to find that my wallet which was beside me, was still intact with my ID and stuff, they had taken my cash though, it would've at least 200 in there. Anyway I don't remember much but I got back home around 1. 

I  woke up a number of times from the soreness of my body and the heat from those bulges and kept on shifting uneasily but I also had a massive headache and they kept knocking me back to sleep. I must've thrown up about 2 or 3 times in that time until I woke up around 10. I felt worse, my whole body felt weak and weighed me down and I stayed in bed and drifted back to sleep until around 4 in the afternoon. I finally managed to get up and I felt pain aching from all over my body especially around my abdomen and rib cage and my collarbone. My jaw hurt like a bitch too. There were swells all over including above my eye, my cheekbone, various areas on my back and my sides. I just slumped back on my chair, in thus awkward position cos everywhere hurt and just felt overwhelmingly depressed like why the fuck would people do something like that, over such a petty thing. I couldn't bring myself do to any of the normal things I did like eat or study or message back my friends or my mom. Around 8, I finally decided to get out to a get a check up on the bruises, I got back from the medical centre around 11 with some pills and antibiotic gel and stuff. I took an X-ray just to be extra sure and everythugn's fine internally. But I still feel out of wack, haven't eaten, and seem to be sleeping in short patterns due to the pain. Every time I recall the punches, I throw up eventhough there is nothing but water coming out. I don't seem interested in doing anything but just sit and stare aimlessly, my thoughts often going back to the night before.

alzheimers? (mother and daughter, the mother is my grandmother and daughter is my mother)

Story: my mother who lived with me previously for 5 months has to come back. She is manic depressive
and has anger episodes that can last up to 8 hours that makes living with her incredibly difficult.
During these bouts she can scream at the top of her lungs, throw things, and be very hard to reason
with.

When she was staying with me the neighbors had complained about odd behavior from her during the day
when I was at work (such as slamming of the door, ringing the door bell 10 times in a row, etc.) and
during her anger episode people came and knocked on my door since she was screaming so loudly and
throwing things. After that I had sent her back to her husband who now can't deal with her either.

The reason I sent her back is she threatened my livelihood and my living arrangement during one of
her episodes: ""I will fuck up your job, and I will fuck up your apartment"" so I can not have her
here for those reasons and the stress that it causes having her in my own home permanently.

He was always good fun and popular, albeit a bit of a loose cannon at times. We ended up living in the same city city for university and during this time Mike began seeing a girl who was to become his steady girlfriend and they both continued our long-standing habit of smoking le marijuana! Suddenly in our third and final year of uni it became clear that Mike was becoming more and more withdrawn and suffering from what I thought at the time was paranoia. It began as the basic paranoia where he thought that we were talking about him behind his back etc. His girlfriend talked with us a few times about it without going into too much detail, but basically she asked us to look out for him and let him know how much our friendship mattered, the usual stuff that friends do for each other. We both told her that nothing had changed in that respect. 

Around this time it became difficult to get in contact with Mike and he became more and more withdrawn. We both kept on his case trying to arrange times to meet up and unfortunately he kept letting us down by not answering or not showing up. The only thing that bothered me about this was that it began to worry me because obviously I didn't want someone who I considered a best friend to be suffering, although at the time I simply put this down to marijuana related side effects. For a small period around this time I believe that he was getting counselled and that he was on medication. His mood did improve but I knew that he ultimately believed that medication is a short term solution to a long term problem.

Also around this time Mike's mother (who he didn't get on with very well) began calling me to ask how her son was getting on. I never let him know about these phone calls as I wanted to provide her with the comfort of knowing that her son is ok and still living. I know that his mother also suffers from some sort of mental illness. 

At the start of that summer we all graduated and never heard from Mike - we didn't know if he had graduated, we didn't know where he was or anything about him. It soon transpired that he had went to live with his father for a while as him and his gf had broken up. I suspect that this sent him into a downward spiral, and to this day he has obviously not got over in. 

Since uni has finished I have only ever talked with Mike over text message, and this is a very rare occasion as he seldom replies. The times that I have talked with him are, frankly, scary for the following reasons:

- he hates himself and feels worthless
- he believes that life is getting worse and that he is a waster
- he is scared of the outside world
- he believes that he is incapable of changing his situation
- he believes that he is useless
- he believes that he is pathetic
- he thinks that his friends hate him
- he thinks that we laugh at him behind his back
- he thinks that people he barely knows laugh at him behind his back
- he has panic attacks (I suspect that they are induced by paranoia)

I would like to add that he was and always has been popular among all our friends. No-one has a bad word to say about him and we surely dont say anything negative about him behind his back. What we do talk about is how much we wish we could help him and how his thoughts are totally unfounded.

He has mentioned suicide recently and actually suggested that he has a date set. Can anyone shed any light on what they think may be going on and also what the fuck I can do as I have no idea where he is, who he is with or where to find him.

The only description I know of is that of Karen Horney's in her book Neurosis and Human Growth. 

I truly feel hopeless about life. At times like these, I'm incredulous to accept I am the 1% or less of the population that has to endure this. I understand neurosis is a hole I've dug myself, but in my defense I had terrible circumstances where the only escape was to, in the sense of neurosis, dissociate and alienate myself and pretend things weren't so bad, because it would have been intolerable otherwise.

I am at a young age of 20. I think things started to go bad (and my coping mechanisms began this ugly mess) at around 9 years old. Parental abuse, near divorce, etc. Dad put the fear of God in me, as in I was mortally terrified of him. I understand there is hope and it's hope I'm looking at. I don't feel that life is worth living with neurosis if I can't work towards solving it. I really don't. Is a mental cancer really worth living with? It is if you can cure it, otherwise it will destroy your life: you may accomplish everything but you will never own it and enjoy it.

At just the age of 20, I see my peers around me just beginning their adult lives. What strikes me so unbearably hard, is the contrast between my state of wretched neurosis, and their state of ... normalness? They are normal happy young adults maturing into men. They are in the prime of their lives, and everything up to this point has prepared them for their futures. They have spent their childhoods becoming secure in themselves, their adolescents developing confidence in relationships and exploring their identity. In short, they have spent the entirety of their lives in constructive genuine growth.

But, to quote Horney:

--

&gt; **But through a variety of adverse influences**, a child may not be permitted to grow according to his individual needs and possibilities. Such unfavorable conditions are too manifold to list here. But, when summarized, they all boil down to the fact that the people in the environment are too wrapped up in their own neuroses to be able to love the child ... (18)

&gt; As a result, the child does not develop a feeling of belonging ... but instead a profound insecurity and vague apprehensiveness ... It is his feeling of being isolated and helpless in a world conceived as potentially hostile. (18)

&gt; The cramping pressure of his basic anxiety prevents the child from relating himself to others with the spontaneity of his real feelings, and forces him to find ways to cope with them. (18)

&gt; his beginning alienation from self. Not only is his real self prevented from a straight growth, but in addition his need to evolve artificial, strategic ways to cope with others has forced him to override his genuine feelings, wishes, and thoughts. To the extent that safety has become paramount, his innermost feelings and thoughts have receded in importance—in fact, have had to be silenced and have become indistinct. (It does not matter what he feels, if only he is  safe.) (21)

--

I am sick of being this way. It isn't living to continue enduring this. It will not improve without help. I think this condition will only get worse since these neurotic fantasies feed on themselves and inhibit any constructive growth.

I feel like my last hopes are Karen Horney's book, and therapy. I realize Horney's theories are just theories, but I have found them to be surprisingly completely accurate. I really don't know how she does this, but everything I've read related to me has described me perfectly. I feel like it can save my life, if I read it very carefully and work things out over the long term. With therapy.

Am looking for extremely specific advice from mental health professionals who have experience with this area.

Generic uplifting comments are appreciated, but can get kind of annoying. This really sucks.

To give an idea of my desperation, I have maintained a diary for only a year, with over 500 pages and 224,000 words in an attempt to self-diagnose and work out my issues. I have grown a lot in being able to identify my intentions, but I come nowhere close enough. Am really looking for help here because I feel very trapped and lost and simply don't feel life is worth continuing with this mess.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,[Neurosis] Help wanted

This friend and I have had some issues in the past of which my friend has spoken about with his psychologist. This psychologist, however, has made some assumptions about me and my mental health. She (the psychologist) told my friend, based off of several text conversations between my friend and I, that I may have a serious psychological behavioral disorder. 

Mind you, I also see a psychologist on a weekly basis and have never been diagnosed with anything, though I do admit I exhibit some traits of codependency and my psychologist has agreed. 

However, my friend's psychologist's assumption is much more than just mere codependency. 

My problem with this is two-fold: 1) I find it professionally unethical to assume a disorder exists based on only one aspect (conversation with my friend), and without performing an examination firsthand, much less to tell your client that! I have never met or spoken with my friend's psychologist. She knows NOTHING about me other than my interaction with my friend. I find it hard to believe that it is ethical to tell my friend that she believes me to have a serious behavioral disorder. And because my friend trusts his psychologist, he too thinks I might have said disorder. I'm afraid that if she said I was a pink rhino, he'd have to seriously wonder if I really am. 2) This isn't the first time I feel she has crossed the line. In the past, she has suggested to my friend that our friendship should end. Again, I find this to be professionally unethical. On the day that occurred, my friend was fine and our friendship was stable. After their appointment, they were convinced that our friendship should end. Luckily, it didn't and I was able to explain why I felt that it was a bad idea to do so. Since then, things have gotten better in our friendship. But I thought their psychologist was being awfully manipulative and overreaching their professional responsibilities.

For the past year and a half, and I guess for much longer now that I'm taking the time to look back, I have been mentally burned out.
I can't deal with stress very well it seems, but the last few months it has expressed into physical symptoms. Headache, zero concentration, tiredness (for a long time already), dry eyes, seeing 'shadow images' for lack of a better term (I look at something, and when I turn away I still see its silhouette, like looking at a very bright light, but what I have been looking at is never actually bright. Think of the teacher in front of the class; when I look away I can still see his entire silhouette in a dark tone).

I have been to a doctor for this, and have had a couple of sessions with a psychologist, but the doctor's advice was ""to try and exercise"" so the mental tiredness would be converted into physical tiredness, and the few sessions with my psychologist were simply not enough.

I study (for as far as I can concentrate) first year Engineering and have passed all classes so far, I have an okay social life, and am relatively outgoing, but all the worries I have, all the work that has to be done, all relations that have to be maintained; it's all way too much. And I feel like I should be able to be in control of it all, especially when I compare myself to my colleagues and fellow students, but I can't. I have trouble bringing up the motivation to study, to even maintain my hobbies (making costumes, gaming, electronics), I am too tired to go out in the evening and nightly hours, most of the time I simply want to sleep but when I have slept, I wake up tired as well.

I could provide more information, but what I want to ask is: how can I regain control of my mental well-being? Should I take a year off studying and really try and fix it (with professional help) without the background stress of the courses I have to finish?

In short: I could be so much more, so much more productive, more motivated and generally happier than I am now, but I can't get there because I have so much anxiety or stress.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I feel like I'm mentally on my last legs, for a long time. What can I do?"

Back in the early days of preschool, and elementary, i would hear voices, and in pre k, i was playing with some kids, and one of them said they were going to poison me (nothing but a joke, I know now). well anyways like 3 months of paranoia went on, and i told my teacher and my mom, and upon my mother hearing that my teacher hadnt done anything, she was going to cuss the teacher ot, and as we were waiting in line to talk to her, I didnt know what to do, so i told her i was lying (I didnt think so at the time) and they were so mad at me that i was beat with a belt where they were in the center and held my arm and when it popped me the y would run me in a circle.

Another thing, my mom is very into disney world, and goes up to four + times a year, and everytime we go as a family, it is terrible, all the yelling, all the frustration. last time i went in 2010, my mom was telling my brother and i to go ride star wars, alone, and Isaid i dont want to many times, and she got really mad and started yelling at me calling me a pussy. It has always been like this, and not all of the time, I can never say I dont get fed, or bought things, but it can be very hectic and i HATE that.

I also have got to where going in stores and places makes me feel nervous, numb feeling, irritated, and a feeling of anger. I get nervous very easily, and I dont know what to say around peopl, because I dont know why but i feel like alot of people are my enemy. also, if sopmeone at makes me mad, I get all cold feeling, and then start spitting when i tlak and come off as being very violent, and most of the time inside i feel threatend and dont know how to respond to people. i aslo get very nervous at stores, or just walking in dense crowds. If you met me, you wouldnt see this, because I am pretty emotionless, unless I cry, which doesn't happen a lot, unless my parents are yelling at me. I only have problems with social thing not physical stuff, such as working alone, or pain. although at times around some people at school, i can get hyped up.

I was joking around with a friend on the school bus, and I said something jokingly about having pornography on a usb flashrive which is false, and were laughing at somthing to do with masturbating alot, and then a few days later, my friend told his brother which told my brother, and I don't do hardly anything wrong on the bus compared to him. well my brother got off the bus, and immediately he went and said this to my mother, and she started yelling at me thinking i am some pervert, and drove me up to my dads litlle house oyut in the woods, and made me explain it, and i told them it was just a joke on the bus, but he turned all red and grabbed my head and started visciouly yelling at me.

Then my brother said ""he's probably weird like this because he's atheist"", then my dad tiurned red and started yelling again, this time about how im not going to ruin the christian heritage, and how they were ashamed, and all the while dropping f bombs and saying goddman. I have heard them say all sorts of things. I was just kidding on the bus, and that joke was over two moths ago. Then after the chaos they wanted to hug me (?) and than after a week or so of ""probation"", all the hell was over.

My dad also get mad at me when I make fun of the rednecks at the flea market, even though they smell of alcohol, wear shirts that show a shotgun and bible on it and it reads ""the only good things, not taught in school"", and always shit talking obama, or talking about tobacco and church. my dad was also talking today about how ""he aint gonna pay them ragheads"" at this one gas station, and then we were driving along, and there was a black male, in his mid fourties, driving in a golden Chrysler, and there were three hats in the back next to the back windshield. My dad talked about if for a good five inutes saying things like 'he's probably trying to fit in, when in rome"" and all these other pranoid things. Once again, my parents can be nice, but these types of things happen off and on.

I am sixteen years old and I am a male, and sorry for all the spelling errors, I rushed to type it all.

I was going to post this to r/depression but I thought this might get more attention since it seems to be less trafficked. If there's somewhere else you think it should be, please say so. 

I'm 26 and male, and all my life I've lived in relative and growing isolation that's peaked over the last five years or so. In 2009 I had a breakdown that prompted me to move to Florida to be closer to my family so that they could easier support me. Previously I had been semi-independent in upstate New York, earning enough to pay for rent but little else.  

In 2010 I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist in Florida with a non-verbal learning disorder as well as depression and severe OCD. This wasn't the first time I'd been to a doctor for mental health problems. Several long and tedious mental evaluations as a small child are some of my first memories, and for my entire childhood I struggled in school and I knew there was something horribly wrong with me. 

I felt broken, hollow, unreal and disconnected, and as if a chunk had been taken out of my brain leaving a huge cavity in my skull and leaving me inept and worthlessly slow and incompetent at anything I tried to do. These feelings persist to this day and have only gotten stronger despite prescription drugs and many dozens of hours of therapy over the years.

I had several close friends until I was ten years old. Not very many, and the relationships were awkward and childish yet fun. They occupied a lot of my time and kept me active and out doors. Then on my tenth birthday I received a computer game from my parents that I'd wanted very badly for a long time. I feel like this may have been a pivotal moment since I decided at the time to abandon my friends at the birthday party to play the game alone in my dark room. 

Ever since that moment I've drifted steadily away from activity with other people, preferring video games and the internet instead. Now I feel like those things are all I really have left, except not really, because they don't satisfy me much anymore. They're just something familiar that I can distract myself with for a few hours at a time. 

Now I just don't know what to do at all. It feels like a lifetime has gone by, and I've forgotten everything I'm supposed to know. I don't even know for sure if it's worth it to re-learn social skills, since I find I don't like being around most people. I have a few old friends on the internet who are more like acquaintances now. They've gotten really tired of me because of how neurotic and unstable and immature I've been with them. At least one decided a few years ago that they didn't want anything to do with me anymore, and I haven't heard much of anything from them since. 

I've developed an obsession with them. To some extent I feel like they are the only real people in the world and that I'll never make better friends than they were or could have been. I'm worried that if I ever look elsewhere for companionship to make up for what they don't provide it'll be ruined because I'll always be thinking of them and what I've missed out on. I feel like without closer ties to them my life has no meaning, and that my only opportunity for personal satisfaction is gone.

I know to some extent this feeling is highly irrational. Somehow even the thought of being happy with others besides these few old friends is terrifying, like it cheapens the idea of happiness or something. But I also sincerely believe it. I've come to believe that most people aren't really people in some meaningful way, or at least that I can't stand being around most of them. They seem more like animals than people to me. They're boring and simple, and often mean and gross and loud. A lot of times it feels like it physically hurts to be near them, especially in a group or crowd.

I had a lot more to say, but I also wanted to be a lot more brief about it than this. It took a supreme effort to write this much, but here's what I really wanted to say. I feel like I'm steadily approaching the end. There's a constant storm inside of me that manifests in real physical aches and pains. Despite conscious efforts to fix myself, to correct and compensate for my psychosis, everything is worse now. I feel close to losing all patience, and even my grip on reality. If I had a quick and easy way to kill myself I would have undoubtedly used it long ago. 

It's strange how much I long to touch and be touched. Not in a sexual way, not what-so-ever, I don't even have much of a sex drive. But just the thought of simple physical intimacy has become mystical in my mind. My bones ache and I feel like the only cure is the warmth of another person. I feel like gender wouldn't even matter that much, even though I'm straight and would prefer a woman. What matters is the contact and intimacy itself, regardless of who its with. 

But that's not something I believe I'll ever have, not the least of which because I'm so terrified of and genuinely hate it. I hate the oily, slimy feel of skin and I find most people semi-repulsive, physically and spiritually. So what is there for me? Just more coldness and darkness.

I'm having trouble working, and over the past few months it has got steadily worse. I'm able to work as well as ever in terms of quality (no fog or fuzziness), but the amount of time before I feel totally drained has decreased massively, to just 3-4 hours a week! If I really force myself to keep going I end up barely being able to get out of bed the next day. It's not that I feel sleepy, it's just like having no energy. Nor is it a lack of motivation exactly... it's more like my body won't listen to my brain telling it to get on with things and just sends back warnings to do nothing (not sleep, or procrastinate online, just do nothing).

I'm not particularly stressed and I'm still enjoying the work. I don't think I'm kidding myself about either of those (I can't keep coasting like this for long before it gets stressful though!). I don't feel depressed either.

Two years ago I started going to the gym (doing about 70/30 cardio/resistance split). About a year ago I started having energy issues a day or two after going. Over time I decreased the number of sessions per week (3-&gt;2-&gt;1) and the amount I did each time (~2h-&gt;~1h). I haven't been at all in a month now and I still feel quite worn out. I don't know if this is the cause or just a sign of the same symptoms though, but I'm a bit scared to restart it just in case.

I have had a dark cloud gnawing away at me for the past 6 years. It all started the summer after my freshman year of high school. I had had a great freshman year- I was smart and fairly good looking, wasn't one of the ""popular kids"" but had a great group of friends on the periphery of popularity. I even had a good thing going with the girl who I was crushing on, and I was very happy. Things changed for me on one summer night while playing a video game (Oblivion, although that's not really relevant). One of the characters mentioned something about being ""imprisoned for eternity"" or something along those lines.

As humans, we hear word eternity and understand that it means an infinite amount of time. In that moment though, my mind chose to focus on attempting to understand the concept of eternity. I began to imagine the concept of what forever might be like. I grew up Christian, and so I began to think about the concept of an eternity in the context of heaven. I imagined living there for a million years, but then realizing that I had not even spent the smallest portion of an eternity there. In that moment I began to feel panic seize my body as an overwhelming sense of despair filled me.

For the following week these thoughts filled my head. I couldn't sleep well. My thoughts soon moved from the concept of eternity in heaven to the concept of nothingness, of death leading to non-being. Initially I thought of it as simply an experience much like going to sleep, if a bit less peaceful. But I realized no, non existence is not like sleeping. While you sleep, you dream. Although you may not be fully conscious, some semblance of you mind stays online, and most importantly you ALWAYS WAKE UP. If you cease to exist, you aren't waking up, you are experiencing that sense of nothingness for all of eternity. A complete lack of consciousness, sensation, and thought that extends forever.
This was when a piece of my mind, for lack of a better word, snapped. I could only get in shallow breaths, while my mind raced in a complete panic, filled with fear. It is the most horrifying, visceral sensation I have ever experienced. For over a minute, I was frozen in my chair, muttering ""ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod"" while my heart beat like a snare drum.

I've carried those thoughts with me ever since, always lurking. It took me over a month before I was able to escape those thoughts for even a moment. It took me about 4 months before I felt like I could make it through an entire day without fixating on them, and until college until I could make it for longer than a few weeks without them. With time, I learned that activity and exposure to people who I care about goes a long way
Now, I'm back at the house where I grew up, where my sibling and parents still live. The three of them are gone for a while, and I am alone, and these thoughts are plaguing me once again. With my family gone and most of my friends from growing up no longer live here, I am alone and I have no one to talk to. All I want to do is get this dark cloud of thoughts to leave me in peace so that I can live my life without the constant threat of debilitating fear.

I've also very recently (yesterday) learnt that I've been self harming for the good part of about two to three years by way of scratching my arms in order to calm myself down, while not always to the point of drawing blood, enough to wreck the skin enough to wear sleeves all the time.

I talk to myself a fair bit. When I'm alone, I'll speak to myself, and I'll have a two way conversation, with one as myself, and another as a real cynic who judges everyone and hates everything.

And lastly, I'm scared of everything. I always feel like my friends will leave me, or that I'll end up a failure, or that I'm simply going to die.

I would go and see a doctor, but I have two main obstacles.

1. I'm scared about being institutionalised. If I'm put in a mental hospital, I'll never get to finish school. Or worse, I might be made to live with my mother, and I have enough trouble with that as it is

2. I would never be able to convince my mother or stepdad to take me, because:
 1. They are a part of the problem. 
2. They think that I can simply just stop the scratching
3. They wouldn't believe me if I said something was wrong with me.

I'm really scared, and I need help. I have a couple of friends I'm talking to that can help calm me down, but I really don't want to be some freak who spends his day talking to himself.

I'm stronger than I was when I was 18, but when I look at myself in the mirror I feel I look the exact same. I'm smart enough to realize that I am getting bigger, due to certain clothes not fitting etc, but if I don't work out for a day or two I feel like I can see myself shrinking in the mirror. I find it almost impossible to gauge how big I actually am. I look at pictures from months ago and compare them to pictures that I take the present day, and although pictorially I can tell I'm bigger, if I look in the mirror I feel on the same size. Not sure if I've done a good job of articulating what's going on, but this is something that really stresses me out. Even though it's probably not the case, I feel like people won't think of me as highly if I'm not big. I feel weak and I feel people look AT ME as weak if I'm not big. I really enjoy working out, but I don't enjoy the feeling the next day of not making any progress. Once again, sorry if I haven't done a good job articulating this.

I have a friend, who I'll call DC. He's 21 and otherwise in good health, but has a history of depression and some unspecified mental issues from when he was younger that I don't know the details of, but he was on meds at one point and hasn't been taking them for a few years. He had a troubled childhood, some behavioral issues and a tragedy that occurred in his family. As an adult he couldn't stay in school or hold down a job for very long, even though he had ample opportunities and family support. Otherwise he was a pretty normal guy, very intelligent and perceptive and generally pretty amicable, and we had a close relationship.

Recently I and our mutual friends have been noticing a shift in his behavior. He has become erratic, up to the point of threatening violence, and very volatile and reactive. His way of interacting with people is now forceful, uncomfortably insistent, and almost seems as if he is challenging them. He's unable to focus on tasks or thoughts and gets easily distracted. The scariest part of it, though, is that many of his perceptions seem completely out of touch with reality. He is convinced that god, or ""the sun god"", is speaking to him. He has called himself a prophet. Today he started telling me that gold is so valuable because humans used to have gold in our eye sockets but it was stolen by the extraterrestrials. He's mentioned the Illuminati and ""the devil"", and he's told me I need to stop drinking the tap water and taking prescribed medication because that's how the government controls us. Today he posted on facebook that he was convinced ""they"" had killed Jai Paul (a British musical artist who is very much not dead), and later posted a status simply stating ""i am very afraid"". I've had a really difficult time concealing how much these things disturb me, and I've told him both gently and very bluntly that I'm concerned for his mental health and I think he needs to get professional help, but he won't listen to me.

I'm torn about cutting off our contact because of how much it disturbs me to see him like this, and how hurtful and distressing many of his words to me have been. I'm emotionally exhausted and it seems like nothing I say is getting through to him. But I don't feel right throwing up my hands and giving up on somebody I care about who obviously needs help. I've thought about contacting his mother, but he's an adult and I'm sure she's already done all she can. There's no way to force someone to seek mental health treatment that I know of (we live in AZ and I'm sure it's not the best around here to begin with).

Basically I met a guy and we started seeing each other, going on multiple dates. We have been continually seeing each other for about 2.5 months now. About 1 month in, after it seemed really good to me, he told me he was dealing with depression and that he didn't think he could handle a relationship. I thought that was the end of it all, even though I didn't want to end it. Anyways, we were apart for a week or so, and then when we arrived back in the same town, we started hanging out like nothing had really happened. He then started introducing me to his friends and kissing me in front of them and all that. Everything seemed good again.

Okay, a few weeks back he really just cut me off out of the blue, and I was kinda hurt and confused and didn't really know what was going on. I eventually (after he ignored my texts for 3 or 4 days) said ""are you ignoring me?"" and he said ""I'm not trying to ignore you, I just haven't felt like talking to anyone"" and then eventually we hung out 2 or 3 days later, like nothing happened. At the end of our ""date"" I laid out how I felt, saying a) I could handle his depression b) I like him and even though I don't understand how he feels, I can take the random ignoring if that's what he needs and c) he shouldn't feel the weight of keeping me happy on his shoulders - I have a life outside of him and feel very fulfilled. He seemed to take it really well and this time instead of ""I can't do a relationship"" it was ""I just need a bit more time."" I was out of town for the week, so he kissed me goodbye and we went our separate ways.

Now, I get back in town, we hang out (very innocently, I just went to his place and we just chatted for a couple hours, and then I left) and then a week passes and I really don't hear much from him. Today I try making plans with him and he texts me saying he wants space and how he doesn't think it's working for him. He says he thinks we should ""sorta take a break"" (whatever that means...)

So after that longwinded preamble, the question: Should I keep trying to hang on to this? I just really think I could care a lot about him, and don't want his depression to push me away if it doesn't need to. I understand things will be hard sometimes, but I am understanding enough to handle it all, even though it's not a feeling that I have myself. I asked if we can cut contact for the week and talk again later, but should I just give up and call it a day?

The Rumination Affirmation

When I was in first year of university, I took an introductory psychology class with my best friend. 4 years later, and 30 more important classes later, not a lot has stuck (something about a prison experiment, baby monkeys getting conditioned for something, some sort of fallacies…. pretty much all a blur). However, there is one word that I will always remember being discussed, as it perfectly described the way that I had been thinking for my entire life: rumination. To ruminate is to continuously overthink about things that have happened in the past, placing emphasis on the negative and creating problems that aren’t actually there.  This is me in a nutshell – some people worry, I ruminate. The latest episode of rumination happened last night as I was trying to get to sleep: that friend request that I sent must not have been accepted because of that thing that I said 6 months ago in passing, or because I am a shitty person and nobody actually likes me.  I know that these things aren’t true, and that the likely reason my friend request was not accepted is because I barely know the person, but my mind doesn’t often work that way. Lately, for the sake of my mental health and well being, I have been trying my hardest to affirm that my thoughts are unfounded and wanted to share my rumination affirmation with everyone else who is dislocating their brain with conspiracy theories.

1)	Nobody thinks about you as much as you think about you – I need to remind myself: I don’t even remember half of the things people said to me 10 minutes ago. Nobody is going to be criticizing the things that you have said in the past, even if they were actually as horrible as you have imagined. Time fixes or removes a lot of stuff, so don’t let your past actions dictate your future.

2)	Talking with someone is better than talking to yourself – With rumination, replaying the same conversation or thought process over and over in your head is a standard. Take the time to say what you are thinking out loud to someone you care about. There is something more finalized about spitting out what has been bouncing around in your head all night long, and speaking requires consciousness, which allows for the foolish things to finally identify themselves as foolish. 

3)	The bleak music isn’t helping anything – sorry, listening to My Number by Tegan &amp; Sara is only making matters worse.

4)	Getting outside and doing things helps, even though sleeping is easier – I realize that this is way easier said than done, but if you have the 1 second urge to get out of bed, take that opportunity.  My friends invited me to see a movie tonight, that I am not interested in seeing, but I jumped at the opportunity because it will keep me occupied and something else will take over my mind. My personal trick is to tuck in my shirt after I shower for the day – it makes me feel like I am important and should be outside of my apartment. 

Rumination is hard. It’s hard on relationships, it’s hard on making friends, and it’s hard on you.  Often rumination is connected with preexisting mental health issues, so if it is too much and feels like it is dragging your life down, seek the most productive help available. Just remember: nobody is thinking that way, you are still alive, people love you. That’s what I try to do.

 I started smoking marijuana as a freshman in high school and while it was great for a few years, it soon left me with way too much anxiety and paranoia every time that I smoked. I knew something wasn't quite right with my mental state.  I grew up in a single parent household and was often left to my own devices after school. I had trouble with motivation and getting school work done. Being surrounded in school by kids that had ADD/ADHD, and were on pills like Adderall or Concerta, I thought that maybe that was my problem too. I tried going to the doctor to see if I had ADD. After seeing a neuropsychiatrist, he didn't think I did, but thought that I suffered from depression or anxiety. This was the first time that I really took a look at myself and realized that this was most likely the problem…but I didn't want to hear it. I wanted the easy fix. 

The first time that I tried any sort of CNS stimulant was my junior year of high school when I bought a 36 mg XR of Concerta from my friend, and I remember that the first time I took that pill that I would be opening up a can of worms. I enjoyed it way too much, the rush was great, and I felt confident in myself not only with school work but also with social situations that I used to cower from. I felt on top of the world every time that I took it, it didn't matter if I didn't eat, I would just study or write music for hours. All of my problems faded away. This was the answer.

Fast forward four years. I've gone through periods of time where I wouldn't touch any stimulants. I dabbled with benzos for a bit, because ""Hey, I probably have anxiety, why don't I try this pill cause I looked it up online and know that it's for anxiety,"" but after a night where I blacked out at work because I drank while on Xanax, I knew that I could not mess with those anymore. But the motivation and lowness that I felt kept calling me back to stimulants. 

Now in the past year I've gone months where I take Adderall non-stop for days, even though I feel guilty about taking it, and knowing that it's costing me too much money. My family notices when I'm irritable and they remind me that I need to eat dinner. I don't know if they put two and two together. They know that I suffer from depression or anxiety or both. I feel that I can't go to work without them. When I don't have any pills, I'm constantly drinking energy drinks, chugging coffee, finding the most caffeinated beverages that I can. It becomes tiring. 

During the months or weeks that I'm not taking pills, I become obsessive with working out and diet. I get nervous about what I eat. I shouldn't eat fried foods, because I know that they'll make me sluggish, but I do anyway, and then I feel bad about it. I wonder if I'm getting enough calories to build muscle. I research what vitamins I should take for optimal health and well-being, if I'm getting enough water, what foods I'm eating, if I'm eating the proper combination of carbs, proteins, and fats, what ratio of fruit to vegetables that I'm eating. 

With working out I wonder if I'm doing proper form, if I'm running correctly. I get nervous that I don't stretch enough, and then I notice that my hip flexors are tight. Is this just from working out, or is this an underlying problem with my body? I become obsessed with my appearance, if my muscular ratios are proper. Do I look clean and presentable? Is my hair too long? And what of these is purely health concern or just because I want to look good, and is therefore representative of an arrogant personality? Am I arrogant? Am I doing these things for the right or wrong reasons?

While on the pills, I can't eat, I'm disgusted at food, but at the same time I know that I need to eat. I've watched my weight drop, and part of me almost likes seeing how skinny I'm getting. Now I can see my muscles more, and I can also see my ribs. I went to therapy for a few months in the last year, but I stopped going because it was too expensive per session…and during the sessions I never brought up the fact that I sometimes dabbled with drugs.

I'm basically asking here for help from anybody that has experienced something along these lines. I don't know if this an addiction problem, a dependency problem, or what exactly it is. I tried SSRI's for a bit, but they seemed to not work for me. I guess I just needed a space to express my thoughts that I have been dealing with for a while.

I use to have a strong sense of identity and a workable sense of confidence. Started loosing it due to stress brought on by over-all dissatisfaction (especially in the self, as that is where all points seem to meet), which I chose to ignore in order to continue doing things that whirlpooled me into a highly neurotic state. Seemingly catastrophic circumstances in life and mind pushed me towards seeking answers in psychedelics.

Long story short it's been 2 years. A year since I checked in and out of a mental hospital (1 month stay). Ended up going completely psychotic and unable to communicate, the anxiety and voices were too much. Them groups, doctors and med's (anti-psychs) did jack shit for me tho.. I ""stabilized"" and bounced once I realized this. Currently I'm being very inactive in an out-patient program. 

Now my day is filled with anxiety and ruminations. My anxiety seems to be about being unable to be my self in society. My ruminations vary from what I did/am doing wrong, how I should be, to how does this mental process thing work at all? Are projections me? Or just people? Even real? I am like this now.. was I ever real? Was my confidence an illusion? Was my identity an illusion? 

By now more anxiety sets in I detach and start scanning for more negative input while I get lost in more arguments within myself. Which is basically retarded because no neighbors would be discussing what I am thinking and doing the whole day, but for some reason this has become and obsessive conviction of mine. Probably reflects on my general attitude towards opinions of people that I shouldn't concern my self with.
I use to be an outgoing, but introverted person (I think)... Now I hate being alone as I think and feel someone is watching and judging me, I can't concentrate and jump at everything. Any random voice, even those of my family spazzes me out. Being around people, especially those I should be calmest and most composed around - is torture. I mean... I get scared that I'm going to get scared to the point of not seeing that there is absolutely nothing to be scared about. To the point that someone might be more scared of me, then I am of them... Children ffs. Characters on TV. I don't understand... who am I compared to them? Will I spaz out again and go all weird and avoidant? Who am I if I do? And of course... I always do. I must be the lowest of lows. I can't look at the world anymore, I look to the side and see it looking at me.

I force my self to go out and socialize, but the pressure throws me towards alcohol and drugs, which sometimes numb me enough to forget ""the problem"". And there are moments that I can smile.. just kind of laugh at it.. But then again, moments later - I become a laughing stock. I can't truly connect... stuck solving some puzzle I have lost all the pieces to. Outside concepts are either completely unrelated to me (not really interesting) or have the atmost significance on my life in a metaphorical sense. Either: the door is shut, whatever, either the door is shut - the fucking DOOR is SHUT - life is OVER, begin badtrip NOW. Or sometimes I just sit there scared that I won't be able to react to whatever is around me.. properly? How I process information is just... fucked. But it USE TO WORK!!!!? HOW!? 

And these ""symptoms""... they just go on and on. I feel like a ragdoll in this fking vertical spinning maze with no fking exits. I use to be a person.. Dafuk is wrong with me? ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,so lost..

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow for something unrelated, and I feel like I should tell the doctor. But it just seems so pointless; I'm happy right now, this is the best I've felt in ages, I'll probably feel happy all summer. I feel like I can get through it on my own; the times that I've been depressed, self-harmed, felt hopeless...all of that's in the past. I feel like this could be the end of my depression, if I try hard enough.

And, I mean, I would feel ridiculous telling the doctor that I think I'm depressed and then not having any of the symptoms of depression. I would be embarrassed telling them. I would rather work through it by myself, because I'm happy for now.

About five years ago, I started becoming really sensitive to the sound styrofoam makes. As I've gotten older it has gotten progressively worse. More sounds bother me and on a higher level. Over time, I have realized its not so much high frequency sounds, but scraping sounds. 

There are a few that REALLY get to me: styrofoam, the sound of a closed pen against paper, and when an edge of cardboard scraping against a flat of it. (Weird, I know). Other noises bother me, but these are the worst. It has gotten to the point where I will either get really light headed or even vomit if I hear a scraping sound. I can't open packages that I know have styrofoam, and I can no longer use clicking pens (fearing I might accidentally use it while the pen is closed). 

I've tried getting myself use to the sounds and desensitizing myself to it, I just get to the point where I'm throwing up and it never seems to get better.

I've had a pretty decent childhood and I have never really suffered from any sort of traumatic experience,  so to speak. So I don't think that what I feel is stemming from some sort of deeper unresolved issue or anything. But for the past year I have been experiencing lots of deeper level thoughts that I am not sure how to handle. I understand that no one in the world knows anything about how the universe actually works, or about why we are all here, or what our purpose is. But what I don't understand is how so many people just seem to be okay with that.

It causes bouts of depression that last for days but eventually go away once I stop thinking about that stuff. However when I do stop thinking about these deeper things I feel like I'm simply ignoring the most essential questions and just going through the motions like everyone else. I've seen several therapists and all they do is give me ""coping exercises"" or some mind numbing drug (I hate prescription drugs). I think that both of those are just different ways of ignoring the deep things and I find it weak that people choose to ignore those things just so they can live comfortably and ignorantly. I feel like I'm slowly losing touch with ""reality"" in favor of the thought of what is happening behind the scenes. At times I wonder if this is what people who go insane spent to much time thinking about because i certainly feel insane compared to other people.

I have a friend. We're really close, I'd say, and we know quite a lot about each other. Today we were out and she drank a bit too much. Some of the things she confessed to me with I knew already, but some I really didn't and I honestly didn't know what to say or how to help her. 
Again, I don't really want help for myself right now, I want to help her, but I don't know how.

(We're both only 17 btw.)

My friend has had a really rough life. Her father used to beat her when she was younger, to the point where she was almost unconscious. She was bullied. Insulted by her teachers. She's been the victim of rape, twice. She told me how she will just use people and then ditch them and that she don't think she'll ever be able to change that, as that's who she is now. She's made many, many mistakes linked to commitment, sex, and other aspects in general before. She attempted suicide this year in April. She told me how she wants to die but is not strong enough to take her own life.

She admitted to me earlier she has a mental disorder but she doesn't take her medication due to weight gain the pills give her. I tried to convince her to take it but she just wouldn't listen. 

Today, she told me some of the things I know for the first time, and I was stunned. She told me she believes she doesn't deserve to live. That she is a horrible person. That she won't be happy until she will stop breathing.
I managed to stay calm through all of that and be there for her as she told me. Later when we were going home she told me to not touch her and to just go home and leave as I left her in front of her door.
Through all of this, she was drunk.

As she confessed to me, for a brief moment she told me how she thinks she deserves better, but then she went back to saying that due to her mistakes and other things, she only deserves to die. 

I really want to help her. Really. I don't know what to do. I realise this is very serious and I admit that I don't know how to help her right now.
Please help me and give me some advice on what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how and I can't take that. Even writing this, I feel like this is my last resort.

I also apologize if this post seems a little disjointed or repetitive; I walked away from it a couple of times.)

Topic's self-explanatory, I guess, but I'll spill everything out.

**RELEVANT HISTORY**

In June 2008, I was in a near-fatal automobile accident when my driver fell asleep at the wheel. I spent a week and a half in the hospital and sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. In the time following, I couldn't read, drive, walk straight (for a while) or stay balanced well, or stay awake for more than a few hours at a time. I went through months of cognitive rehab, which helped a lot, and was put on a slew of meds that I don't even remember. After a rough first semester ""back to life"" (I failed a class, and nearly-failed another, due to reading difficulties), I eventually finished my degree and earned a secondary teaching certificate (December 2011). There were some rough patches when the insurance company stopped paying for (REALLY DAMN EXPENSIVE) medications during which I got very sick and couldn't focus or really function too well. I eventually weaned off of my meds around the time I finished my degree, and noticed a return to almost-normality, though with some persistent difficulties (fatigue sets on pretty easily, it seems, I forget ""little things"" more often, and I read a lot more slowly, to name a few).

**NOW**

I'm on the lowest dose of generic lexapro (I forgot what it's actually called), and it's been brought up that I ""probably don't need it anymore"" since the 1-2 weeks I went without it (due to shipping problems), I didn't notice much of a difference at all. I didn't take myself off outright, however, because I was afraid that there *would* be issues, and I did *not* want them to crop up during my first year as a full-time teacher.

I finished my first year as a full-time teacher just a couple of weeks ago. It was very stressful at times, but I don't think I ever noticed anything out of the ordinary as far as my handling of the stress. In fact, with work-related stress, I found myself handling things pretty damn well! I took on several added duties, and worked like a champ. The school year ended very well - so well, in fact, that I was already appointed head of sixth-grade ELA curriculum for the whole district, based on how well I seemed to do with my reading groups - and I signed a contract to return this fall.

*That's* what I'm worried about, however. I'll be returning to a familiar place with familiar faces and familiar stresses, so it won't be quite as bad on that front, right?

Well, yes. However, I teach on an isolated island village in northern Alaska. More on this in a bit.

**WHEN IT BEGAN**

I first noticed something fishy this past holiday season, when I returned home to my family in Michigan. I was just fine for at least a few days, maybe a week, but after a little while, I noticed that I was starting to feel really antsy for no *actually* discernible reason. Things have always been on-again-off-again tense between my family and I (they're generally supportive and loving, so it's not like I return home to hell, or anything), but this was incredibly unusual. I thought maybe I was getting sick - difference in climate, change in diet, whatever might cause it - so I dismissed it for a few days.

However, it persisted. I had a very long winter holiday (ours is about 4 weeks long), and with few exceptions, it only got worse. I felt sicker, I lost my appetite, I actually *dropped* about ten pounds (I exercised a lot while I was home), and I couldn't sleep. I was likely averaging 2-4 hours of sleep a night for like 2-3 weeks of break, with a night or two of no-sleep-at-all, and while I found myself pretty damn tired throughout the day, I also found that I had a good amount of ""energy"", too. I was kind of hyper, sometimes, so I'd ride a stationary bike and it actually helped me calm down a bit afterwards.

Since it seemed to help, I actually started working out and running a lot more in what little free time I had, even when I returned to work. I felt better about myself as a result. But the panic attacks during winter break didn't stop.

I found myself seeking what, in retrospect, must have been ""familiar comforts"". Most notably, I declared feelings for an ex-girlfriend (from several years ago, and with whom I had since remained good friends) expecting lord-knows-what (things are fine, I think, we still talk and stuff). I called - even mid-panic - friends just to see them. I played video games (I used to do this a *lot*, but not for some years, really). Stuff like that.

I also noticed that I felt a *lot* better - *immediately* when I returned to the island. I was stressed-out, now and again, but there was never anything incredibly strange about how I handled it.

**NOW...AGAIN**

...I returned home to Michigan a couple of weeks ago, and the past week or two have been fine.

A few days ago, I noticed I was feeling a bit headachey and sickish, and I thought it might be the lack of sleep/time change, but, since yesterday, it's been happening with some slight chest pressure and ""swimmy"" sort-of headaches, and I recognized that the only other time I've ever felt this way is this past winter holiday season.

I don't seem to have triggers or thoughts that precede these onsets, but I am in the midst of one right now. I'm hoping that my old doctor calls me back tomorrow and that I can set up an appointment, but in the meantime...any advice from anybody, or help making sense of all this, would be appreciated.

So I'm a software developer of sorts (beginning really, I'm still in high school haha) who has continuously dealt with depression/anxiety/sleep problems. Frequently I've been asked by my mental health professionals (therapists, social workers, psychiatrists) to track my mood and it's response to certain events. However, I haven't come across an app or website that I like to use. All of them are either overly complicated, take too much time, or are aesthetically unappealing. And even if I do track my mood, my therapist or psychiatrist will only be able to see it when we meet. So I thought of a solution. What if there was a website and phone/tablet apps to go along with it that were beautiful looking, easy to use, secure, simple yet configurable to be more powerful, and gave me daily reminders to check-in either by email or push notifications? And on top of that, what if my therapists/psychiatrists could have a professional account on the same service, where they had access to my mood graphs and check-ins? Currently I feel like I'm treated on a schedule, every couple weeks or however often I can meet with my therapist/psychiatrist. In the meantime my mood is free to go wherever it wants, changing from happy or neutral, to suicidally depressed, all with in a day or two's time. What if my therapist's involvement in my treatment was more constant? I know when I have suicidal days my therapists always tells me after the fact that I should've called her, but honestly I had no motivation talk to her when I felt like that. But if I simply marked that on my mood tracker, and she was automatically notified by text and email, then I possibly could have gotten help I was desperately in need of, but wasn't motivated enough to reach out for. It's going to take a lot of work to build this service and then get mental health professionals to adopt it, and it will only be possible if there's interest in using it by those who need the help. So before I put weeks and months of my life into building this service, would you guys be interested in using something like this? Oh, and personal accounts would be completely free, and you wouldn't have to have it linked with your therapist's account, that would simply be one possible option to help improve treatment. If you guys have any suggestions or concerns, voice them! Thank you so much in advance!

One more thing, for those people who are mental health professionals, would you be willing to try a service like this for yourself first and then possibly recommend it to your patients? And would you be willing to pay a small monthly fee each month to have access to a ""professional"" account with access to all your patient's mood graphs and check-ins? And are there any features you'd specifically want in a paid mental health professional account?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Mood tracker that reports to clinician - Interest?

I've destroyed my mind over the last ~20 years. Coupled with a non-existant diet, I've become a reclusive, self-doubting, paranoid, anxious, and have no self-esteem.

I hurt two of the closest people to me recently, and it's made me see that I can't continue like this. In the process of being angry and scared about the way I feel, I crushed two very important people. I may have lost them forever...and that just scares me even more.

I have seen my GP and a counsellor is being arranged at the moment. I know I can go through with all of this now, partly because I had some amazing support before I fucked it up, and partly because the pain of fucking that up made me see just how bad things are.

My question is ""Is it too late?""

A lot of what I've read so far has been along the lines of just avoiding intrusive thoughts...but is that really enough? Have I not conditioned myself to be like this now? I'm prepared to work for this, but is it going to work? Again, this all comes down to self-doubt, I see that.

So back in March, my brother had a very serious accident if you will. He was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago and got put on Zoloft. It seemed like he was doing well up until a few months ago. Apparently, he starting freaking out and sounded as if he was having a panic attack and called the house and hung up. Later, I guess he went full on psychotic and thought he died and was with God while at a restaurant, and when he left, fell out a window and cracked his skull. After this, he spent weeks in the hospital where he was diagnosed with Asperger's and anxiety. (He is extremely brilliant but has always been a bit off socially. He doesn't really have friends or speak to anyone in my family, other than my parents, despite our reaching out to him). Anyway, the psychiatrist put him on a small dose of seroquel as well, 25 mg. Yesterday, he called the house again saying that he had racing thoughts. My parents talked to him for 5 hours straight. He went to the hospital and called the paramedics prior to calling our house. He kept saying things like ""You are all really good people"" and apologizing for being ""useless"" and said that he's not crazy. Then, he started ranting about how he needs an individual to share life with and loves how my family loves each other and was crying (this is extremely atypical language and behavior from him). I guess at the hospital, they tried to sedate him with pills, and my parents had to convince him for an hour and a half that the pills were safe. Also, he didn't believe the paramedics were real doctors, and refused to let me dad talk to the doctors. He freaked out when my dad had to get off the phone for a second to use the bathroom.

Anyway, they finally got him put to sleep, and my parents are flying out to England to see him. The doctors want to put him in an institution. I'm curious as to what you guys think this is. I don't think it's just Asperger's and anxiety, and we're all worried.

Using a throwaway since some people I know in real life know my redditor name. 


**Some Background:
**
My brother is 36 years old, Sister is 31 and I'm 27 years old. Our parents are stable with my mother being a bit of a drinker, but other than that. No broken home issues.

With my father being away working two jobs during my brother's teenage years my brother stumbled into a drug problem, from what he's told me, he's done everything under the sun other than heroin and crystal meth. He was in and out of rehabs all over the country trying to correct the problem and getting away from his problems. He cleaned up from the age of 22 to about 27 moved back home to work at the family business and then fell back into the hole after a losing bout with steroids, cocaine and heavy alcohol use. 

*During this time I felt he really had his first episode,* He called me frantically thinking the feds were after him and that people were following him until he locked himself into his apartment and until I finally came by to let us inside, he flushed all of his drugs down the toilet and was shivering on the couch, it was time for him to get out, again. 

He then moved to california, moved into sober living house, completely cleaned up and met a lovely woman to boot. He met this woman, we'll call her Angie, she was a bit of a hippie and smoked some pot once and awhile and drank a bit. My brother then adopted this lifestyle. In October of 2010 I went over to california for a month to see him and check out how he was doing, everything seemed awesome, his girlfriend though partied a bit, had a solid head on her shoulders and heart in her chest. It bothered me that he smoked weed and drank, however I soon realized he had complete control this time, he seemed to finally settle into his niche, he functioned well under just living a little fuzzy and kept a fine balance of it and has had a firm grasp on that since. Angie had a child from a previous marriage who my brother took to becoming a stunning example of a father, always saying how ""he never wanted to be like dad."" He made sure he was as affectionate as possible and picked the kid up from school everything.

Now here is where a wrench is thrown into the works, all 3 of them moved back over the east at this point and decided to start a life out here to be closer to family (she and him both have family nearby.) I helped them move into their beautiful house and everything. This is when I noticed that something went weird, my brother when he came back took on the lifestyle of believing in crystal energy, auras and chi's. He is downright fanatical as a a preacher at a bar on a saturday night trying to get you to believe this stuff, I get a long with him thinking ""it can always be drugs,"" and never put him down for him preaching to me, however things get weird when he says he can communicate with the dead and see angels flying around him. He's calmed a bit since, but I was legitimately frightened at points where he yelled at me because I wasn't trying hard enough. I can't tell if it's sociopathic nature or the way he really is. That is the besides the point.  

Now that wrench I was speaking about, My brother and Angie decided to go on a vacation together, where, he wanted to propose to her! he had his ring the suitcase. 

The way he puts it, he was lying on the beach holding down the fort when she was walking up from the beach her phone vibrated, being in the relationship they're in they usually don't mind looking at eachother texts to just let the other know what's going on or if something was urgent. However, this text was from her boss saying ""I miss you riding atop of my cock."" At this point I have no idea what happened, all that he called me the next morning at around 3am saying ""It's your brother, I'm in ***** call me."" Now I had no clue he was where he was at the time and I flipped the fuck out till my father told me the deal and what had occurred. He was devastated, he's a broken soul and since that event, he seems not to be able to shake it.

He moved home back to my parents for a bit to get his shit back together and frequently i'd see him crying or depressed so I spent as much time as possible with him as I could but could see him get visibly upset and shaken when I'd tell him ""I can't hang out, I'm at college/second job/with lady friend,"" Very Rageful.  My most personal recent episode with him was during mother's day with when I was leaving I went out for a cigarette and went to say goodbye to him and he was talking out loud to himself, crying. 

So More recently he moved back out to the country by himself a little bit further away, he's had money troubles and recently inquired borrowing cash from me, my parents and my sister, however we feel at 36, he should be able to nurture and carry himself by this time. He MOST recently came to my parents on sunday to ""talk"" which basically means...borrow money, and my parents told him no, then he flipped on them saying all this shit how his life is because of him, how no one ever helps him...then how he can talk to angels and communicate with the dead...and then past thoughts about hurting himself (which troubles me the most.)

He's not the one to get help, he is completely against the 'institution,"" firm believer in Terrence McKenna or Jack Kerouac kind of mindset, that doctors are crooks and that nature will take care of him. However, I'm afraid that he's going to hurt himself or further slip back into drugs.  


My question is, how does one approach this situation? I don't have time to drive an hour away and hang out with him to make sure he's okay, I work two jobs and am putting myself through college at 27. But at the same time I feel like I'm the only one who really cares about him, my sister just writes him off as a loon and is busy with her own family, my dad is in denial and usually just swallows whatever is thrown at him and my mother legitimately thinks he has bipolar or schizophrenia.

I feel almost nothing. Emotion is not a driving factor in my life.

90% of my time I sit inside at my mom's house. And I sleep or I go on the internet. Not much pulls me to read it, I don't get excited about new music to listen to it, and when I do engage in those activities, I'm barely moved by them.

It's not sadness. It's not really anger. It's not even really confusion. It's not really frustration. It's a slight discontent. It's mostly like my brain is in a cell wishing it could be free. My brain occasionally gets enough energy to scratch another line in the wall to remind me how long I've been trapped here, but mostly I'm just a lazy blob of nothing.

 It's not as though zero emotion is present, it's that I can't feel it. I can best explain this subdued feeling as an underwater current. There is a soft current of emotion underneath the water, but I am so dissociated that on top; on the surface, I am completely still and stoic. 

Maybe I'll smile. Maybe I'll be funny on social media. Maybe I'll have a passionate argument. But there is no emotion felt.

I know there's a problem, but I don't feel anything in order to fix it. I can say, ""YEAH! tomorrow I'm gonna go out and get a job!"" or ""LET'S DO THIS! I'm gonna start working out!"". But it never lasts. Nothing brings me to do it. It's all short lived.

And aside from a tiny sense that I know I should be embarrassed, I don't even care that I know it could be a lot worse. It's like, I'm self aware that nothing's REALLY wrong with me, but it doesn't change the fact that every day is the same. Every day nothing happens. I barely ever leave my house. I have no money because I don't work. I don't write lyrics because I'm lazy and have nothing to write about. 

Bottom line is. I just don't know what to do. And I don't even know how to describe this lack of emotion. I don't even know what to research or what to think about.

Please. Anything at all will help. Please think about it.

Edit: Even writing this feels incomplete. But then again, I've thought about writing down my thoughts before and I finally did it by submitting this!

Edit 2: I should include my goal. ... I want to be an emotionally healthy human being. I want to be passionate, happy, funny, sad, angry, influential. All of those things. I want to be free and travel places and FINALLY after over 20 years, make a group of friends that feel like a family. (I'm in my early 20s). I want to be successful with my music and have the type A personality of someone who is going to go out and chase their dream. I don't want to sit on the damn couch anymore.

Well to start, I am a 20 year old male, I have a job that I have mantained for the past 2 years, along with a Girlfriend of 2 and a half I met in High school. I have been pretty socially awkward during most of my life, especially in high school, I normally just put this on playing too many video games instead of going like most the other kids would do, but I feel it is a bit more than this. I've never considered myself as despressed or ever had any thought that I might have a slight mental disorder. I've always been a really nice guy, almost too nice, too the point that I am willing to be nice and do favors for people even if in the end it is detrimental to myself, my time, or takes a negative consequence on my life.

I remember in high school, I would see people wearing certain clothes, certain accessories, that were very trendy in my high school, that I personally thought looked nice, or decent, but could not ever picturing myself wearing/doing this trend, because I didn't think of myself as a normal person(not sure this is the proper way to explain this, but I litterally felt as thought I was not accepted in anyway, and that I was not the same as anyone else, the latter of which can sound good, such as someone being unique, but this wasn't the case, I felt, very unaccepted, felt as if everyone always had their eyes on me, thinking about all the bad things I wore or did, and that I couldn't escape this)

I came to the thought of this possible mental disorder after being on a popular social media website, and seeing someone posting/sharing a status that promotes meeting new people via facebook, and I litterally thought to myself ""Man I wish I could do that"", I found this so weird, why did I wish I could do something, If I wanted to do that, I could, but my head was telling me I wasn't allowed to, which I just couldn't grasp. I thought for a while about this, and still cannot think of a good way to explain the way I feel or classify myself as a person. I know that scientifically I am a human, and I am an equal to these people, but mentally I don't feel that way.

I mostly feel like I don't even know my parents that raised me, I feel as If I cannot open up to them at all, most days after school/work I'd return home, go to my room, play video games and then sleep, without more than a few words exchanged, now after realizing this I've tried to be a lot more social with my parents, and trying to make them more of an active part of my life, but I don't feel as if this is the main problem, just merely a symptom.

After being in a relationship with my current significant other, I've realized that after we have gotten past the stage of being all lovey dovey, that I was incredibly dependent on her, I can't make decision on my outer image alone, I need approval of someone, for example, when we go to the mall, I cannot, and I mean cannot shop for clothes alone, I find clothes that i think look nice, but I can't imagine them looking nice on me, I need her to pick them out, and tell me they look good, for me to be able to go through with getting them and wearing them.

Also, some things I have found strange, is that, I don't feel certain emotions that are expected out of certain situations. For example, when I recieved the christmas present I wanted all year when I was 12, I was glad I had gotten the gift I wanted, but my parents expected me to flip out and be overly excited, which i from then on out tended to fake being overly excited about gifts just to seem normal. Another, more recent example: My grandfather passed away about a year and a half ago, and although I was sad, and very upset that it happened, I didn't outwardly express these, I was just kind of like ""man that sucks"" even though inside i knew the severity of it, so I knew I had to act out being a little bit more sad and upset then I actually felt. Now I'm not saying I don't feel emotions or any of that stuff, I still get mad when I lose money, start yelling and cheering when my favorite team scores/wins

I'm not sure if this has been a bit hard to follow, but I have been questioning myself whether it has to do with some possibility of a mental disorder or me just having incredibly low self confidence, and have since I was a child, and still lack the ability to believe in myself

Basic info is that i have ADHD, am depressed and am a mild hypochondriac although i've started catching myself when my mind is talking complete shit about what i feel (phantom symptoms like anxiety attacks and such). I used to smoke a lot of cannabis and just experiment with drugs; trying pills and such but have now halted due too urine-tests.

I will bring up the possibility of having APSD with my psychologist (who when i think about it never am completely truth-full with) on our next meeting but for now i want to see your opinions...

~~~

Let me go over the list of MY symptoms:

Generally people think i'm quite charming and easy to talk to; at least adults (although that charming chap doesn't feel like me). People my age though think of me as awkward and talking to much, although i could be completely wrong about all this since psychopaths have difficulty reading this kind of stuff. I do have a handfull of good friends but not many casual friends. I isolate everybody except my closest from the ""true"" me, not being unpleasant but rather not caring.

I lie impulsively, if someone asks something i lie just so i don't have to bother with it being brought up later.

I steal things from people without any guilt or thinking about the consequences. For instance pills, money etc.

I have gotten ""busted"" for drugs. I don't think i need help so I disregard all support i'm given. When i was younger i shoplifted (i was a brat that wanted to be cool i guess), got busted so i stopped because of it ruining my image in the eyes of my elders, when all that passed i did the same again. So you can easily say that i don't respect authority and disregard all rules since in my mind I did nothing wrong.

I don't have any plans for my future and can't make any either.

I kill bugs and whatnot without remorse, just ""because"". I just find it enjoyable somehow. I could easily kill large animals (never would i intend to hurt my pets or friends) if i had the chance and i'm afraid that i could do it with humans to.

If someone is sad i can't really see it from their POV, don't understand the reason for the sorrow and can't feel sad myself. For instance in movies i'm completely untouched by all emotions other people go through.

I don't manipulate people to gain form it though. I've never ""planted"" thoughts in peoples heads so they do my deeds for me so to speak.

Although i use people to be happy myself without giving a fuck about people involved.

I don't see myself however to have an absence of nervousness. And neither do i have an absence of delusions (when something happens i tend to think the worst imaginable will happen when it's illogical) 

I'm not violent either. If i get angry i can control lashing out by realizing it's innapropriate and will ruin my image. 

~~~

Ask questions if i have been unclear about something

I'm really worried..

I found someone who's like a mentor to me, he's (unknowingly) kept me from ending it all many times and when I feel down all I need is a short message from him and all is fine. Now there's a new situation (new job) which would mean I would be more independent from the abusive people in my life but I wouldn't be able to see him whenever I need to anymore. As soon as I found out I got the job my brain absolutely lost it, total panic, fear of abandonment, feeling like I was drowning (instead of being happy and proud or whatever). Last time I felt like this was years ago when I was in a long-term relationship with an abusive person and thought I wasn't good enough, worthy enough to keep him. I swore to myself I'd never let myself get into a situation where I felt like that again. I've never experienced something more painful. 

Now, that I might not see my mentor-guy whenever I need to (we'd still be in contact, just not face-to-face), I feel the exact same as I did back then. He's been the most emotionally healing person I've ever had in my life and I trust him completely with my feelings and thoughts, and he would never abuse it in any way and will always have my best interest at heart. But my happiness and mental well-being totally depend on him being there for me.

Recently I have become increasingly concerned about my mental health.

I currently know (I have been diagnosed) with the following *Depression(I've taken every SSRI and SNRI with no improvement) *GAD *ADHD-PI (I take vyvanse 30mg on and off) *OCD

Anyways, recently I have noticed more symptoms besides my initial mental conditions. I have been noticing that I am much more paranoid and anxious. My thoughts feel much much more cloudy.

Here's whats really bothering me. I keep on hearing a random whistle at night. Its not sustained, so I don't have time to figure out if its real (half a second at best.). I've also noticed if I fall asleep in class, I'll feel as though I am using my phone browsing reddit, even though my eyes are closed and I'm half asleep. Normally I would chalk this up to dreaming, but I can awake from it at any time, and I am aware its not real. When it gets really bad, I start worrying that I might loose control of myself and go full crazy. Its never actually happened, and I dont know how real of a risk that is.

I am able to tell that the paranoia, anxiety, and obsessions are not reality if I just take a few breaths and calm down. Still its EXTREMELY uncomfortable.

My psychiatrist is a joke, but hes the only one within 200 miles of me. I told him all of this, and his response was to try to put me back on cymbalta and xanax

Does this sound like the beginning of psychosis?

It all started about 3 to 4 months ago when in class my friend randomly hit me as I was talking to him. Naturally I hit him back... only he never hit me in the first place! I had imagined it and hit him for no reason! Also around the same time I was out for a late night walk by myself and saw a massive golden shooting star which although I believed it was real at the time, I'm really starting to doubt if this is even possible. Finally, the last event happened around the same time and was when I went to a concert with another friend. I thought I was cheering the name of the person I had gone to see but I was actually shouting my own name at the top of my voice!!

Since then, no weird events have happened but I have almost constantly felt like I'm in a strange mood. One thing is that I have really out of place emotions and tend to laugh manically, often for no reason (eg. I found myself laughing uncontrollably in an exam and in a sad school assembly).

I also have lots of trouble speaking. I can never think of the right words to express my thoughts. Because of this I often make up words or just give up speaking all together as I find it too hard and frustrating to try and say what I'm thinking. On top of this, I often feel like my mind is almost ""foggy"" and not working fast enough. The best way I can describe this is a headache with no pain but means It takes a lot of concentration to focus on even the simplest decisions and tasks (and when I am distracted by somebody talking to me, I either ignore them or get extremely frustrated with them very quickly). It also makes me feel spaced out, distant from both my body and the outside world.

Because of all of this, I like to be alone and love the darkness as there's no distractions meaning my mind feels clear and crisp. This means I go on lots of late night walks by myself, often I end up running about and swinging on lamp posts as I have an random urge to move at around 2 in the morning! On these walks I tend to excessively talk to myself if I have no music to distract me. I find myself arguing and even insulting myself, as if I had multiple personalities inside my head (although I'm aware and in control of all of them).

Finally (I know this sounds crazy) I sometimes feel like a vampire. Now don't get me wrong, I KNOW I'M NOT but I can't help but find the darkness soothing, bright sunlight frustrating (often causing the foggy feeling) and I get random, VERY VIOLENT thoughts which honestly I find more intriguing then horrifying. Also as much as I know it's not true, I can't help but feel like I'm being watched/stalked by a strange cult at night which will one day ask me to join them (that sounds as crazy to me as it probably does to you but I can help but feel that way).

All of this is very strange for me. I've always been a nice person and if you asked my friends they would probably say I'm very kind and intelligent. I have always loved science and maths but nowadays I find it hard to concentrate, often lacking motivation to learn new stuff and work hard. Any insight into any of this would be very, very appreciated as right now I just feel confused and unsure why this is happening.

My brother has always been pretty shy and introverted. About 10 years ago(he was 20) he began getting really involved with spirituality and researching different ways to alter the psyche. He bought a device that would flash led lights and produce sound waves for you to hear and look at. A few years after he told me the purpose of this device was to put your mind in a state where you can create reality... He also would drink excessively to the point of blackout pretty often and was smoking a lot of weed at the time.

I think a combination of the binge drinking and weed, along with the mind altering things he was doing lead to an emotional breakdown. My dad took him to the doctor where he was diagnosed with psychosis and prescribed respirdon(sp).

So after this, my parents who are extremely hard working, normal, typical loving people weren't really sure what to do and were a bit shy to maybe talk to therapists or reach out for more help due to the stigma of mental health.  Just went with the idea to let the drug work and hopefully he would turn it around.

The result ended up being years of my brother drinking, he had alcoholism and has to drink every night. He worked a few off jobs here and there but now he's unemployed. For a few months he took himself off the drug, stopped drinking, lost a bunch of weight. Which was awesome! But then something happend recently and he relapsed and started acting very delirious, indecisive, and just seemed almost like a different person.

My parents took him to a psychiatrist where he was prescribed more drugs. It's very sad to me as he was my role model growing up. He's a loving, sensitive person. But I can tell he's suffering and in a lot of pain and needs help. I'm pretty lost at what to do. Please send suggestions

So if you have any experience in the mental health field, please tell me what you think might be wrong with me.)

Okay. So I want a diagnosis of what you think I might have. 

I had an internet female friend/acquaintance. She didn't want anything to do with me anymore back in September. She's 23, turning 24 soon. I'm 21. Now I bugged her everyday from September to December of 2013. An then I started again April 2014 and I stopped after I told her off. 

She was the only one who knew I was suicidal and made me a lot worse off by trying to convince me to kill myself. Between October 26 an October 28 of 2013 she was throwing everything back in my face trying to get me to end my life. She even said that she wished my suicide attempt worked and told me to go to sleep and not wake up. Her name is Maaria, but I will not be saying her last name. Anyway, she thought I was obsessed with her when I really just wanted a friend because I feel VERY alone. So like it comes and goes. 

Basically what she did to me was have it so I think about suicide way more than I ever did. Like last week I'm was planning on killing myself today or sometime this week. She told me to go to sleep and never wake up. I don't care about her no more since I told her off last month. I planning on telling her off some more. She even had a girl drop out of school when her dad died. Maaria made the girl look like the school whore. The girl had to leave the school and this was after her dad's death. Maaria was bragging about this. So there is something psychologically wrong with this girl. She is friends with a sociopath and works with kids and wishes death on her sister for some pity bull!sh!t. She even thought about asking God to kill her sis (I’m an atheist now). 

Anyway from her making me more suicidal and telling me to go to sleep and not wake up, I tried to kill myself via her idea. I closed all the windows and doors in my house. I put water on the stove and to stop the fire from coming out to let the gass escape. I made a gas chamber trying to kill myself. When I felt the side effects of what I was doing, I panicked and called the suicide hotline.

Now as I said before I was planning on trying it again this week. I brought some zzzquil, so I can fall sleep from that before I have a chance to panic from the gas/ carbon monoxide. I’m not trying to kill myself because of this girl, but because I feel that I'm a defective product, no one likes me, my mother said to me once that she should of aborted me, Maaria wants me dead and I have no one to talk to. I’m ashamed to say last week I was hitting myself, I saw myself as a f*ck up. This girl Maaria said she fines me worthless, which didn’t help and I think that’s what got it in my head that I’m lower than sh!t. Now this is how I felt last week, but now I feel close to fine. I don’t feel like killing myself anymore. However these thoughts and feelings comes and goes. I was told I have personality disorder and adjustment disorder. Obviously there are some other things wrong with me I'm trying to get help for that. I’m going to see a social worker tomorrow to undo the things that Maaria helped do to me. I’m a danger to myself and I want/ need help. This girl feels no emotion at all and is kinda creepy. Her and her friend really did a number on me. An she gets pleasure from hurting me and pushing me to the point I almost died. She said that she LIKES being a b!tch and she’s not changing for no one. To put it simply, she’s psychotic and crazy. 

I feel alone, I’m clingy, I feel like I don’t fully even know myself, sometimes I really don’t even like myself, sometimes I look down on myself, I feel lost and I just don’t know why I’m like this. I don’t like talking about me being suicidal anymore because people think I’m seeking attention (even though I tried to erase myself.) I feel that if I’m gone, then the problem will be gone. I feel like it’s better if I just died. This Maaria girl, even said “Seriously just end your fucking life already”. Seeing how so many people look at me as annoying, a MEGA creep (Her ugly ass BF called me that) and everyone wants me out of there lives, that it’s for the best if I’m dead. It really is though. I’m not exaggerating. NO ONE LIKES ME! An I’m really better off dead. Like I really don’t need to be here. Even someone told me once “This world does not tolerate people like you.” and “You'll never make it. Sad, but true.” I really don’t need to be here. I don’t like myself, I can’t stand myself. I wanna erase who I am, I wanna erase my memories and start ALLLLL over. I wanna be SOMEONE ELSE completely. I wanna be normal.

I like it when my mom is out of the house so I have time to do it. I told my mom about all of this and me wanting to kill myself. She called me a burden because now she has to worry about me. Then after like 2 or 3 weeks, she acted like I got better. I guess I regretted telling her, so I led her to believe that everything was better. I told her on my 21st birthday when I got scammed out of $225. This was February 17, I admitted to my mom I think about suicide.

As I said I really hold back from telling people about me being suicidal now, because I really don’t want people to have to say I’m seeking attention, when I’m really seeking advice and help. Maaria did say that people should die, if they wanna die. LOL She really was trying to get me to kill myself. But that proves all my points. See what I’m saying.

So is there anyone here with some experience, that might be able to help tell me WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH ME?!

I've had a very rough background including physical, psychological and sexual abuse at a very young age. 
I'm not sure if that's exactly the cause but I have been diagnosed with Dysthymia. For those who don't know, it's a lower-intensity, longer-lasting clinical depression. 
I've seen therapists and feel like I'm ""buying a friend."" Talk therapy, exercise and good food usually helps me get on the right track and generally feel better. I do not feel I need medication, as I am often able to manage my symptoms solo. 
About 4 times a year though, sometimes more, sometimes less, I feel like I'm slipping. It terrorizes me. I don't like feeling that way. I actually get angry because I feel that way without reason. I used to look for a reason, and a small argument, etc would become the reason I am depressed. 
Anyway, moving on to the actual issue...

I fear that I've become Neurotic in the recent past and need help coping with it. 
I fear not being heard, not being understood, not being listened to. Recently I had a dear friend pass away, but had a complete meltdown when it seemed like all my friends were too consumed with their own lives to help me feel a bit better. 
It feels like being alone stirs the pot I keep the depression in. I certainly admit to being a bit self-centered about the matter, but feel like I have the right to be. ""No one else thinks of me - why not be self-centered about it?"" That logic makes sense to me for some reason. 

I fear being alone and misunderstood to the point where I regularly justify my actions, my thoughts, my feelings. I feel like I cannot independently trust my instinct so I run it by someone to feel validated. And if my action is wrong, at least I didn't chose it alone. I don't share the responsibility of any wrong-direction choices, just take comfort in knowing someone else would have made the same choice I did. 

I don't know what's wrong... I don't want therapy. I have been told I should see someone, but I immediately get defensive and take it as a, ""I don't want to deal with you, so pay someone until you come back perfect."" It's probably a perception issue on my part, but therapy doesn't feel like a path I want to take. And I view my coping mechanisms as easy... just surround yourself with positive people and it usually goes away. 
 
TL:DR - I am a sufferer of Clinical Depression // Fear I may be neurotic. I need advice on coping / treatment that doesn't involve prescribed drugs or therapy. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Neurotic?

  Due to my dads behavior I am unsure if he is mentally ill, had a stroke that went unnoticed or is plain old stupid. If it is indeed mental illness I would like to get him help as he is actually a pretty good guy at heart. He just does and says things without thinking or understanding what he sounds like. Sorry for the long post, but I am actually concerned and would like to hear some feedback. I would like to add that none of these things are said in a joking manner.

  Firstly, he hates woman. He swears he does not hate them, but then comes out with things that make him sound like a crazy guy. As an example, my 1 year old girl was sitting on his lap ripping apart a napkin at the dinner table. He says ""See, only a female would destroy something for no reason. She is not interested to see how it works, she just wants to destroy it. Boys don't do that"". As if somehow she was a little evil-mastermind getting to work on the napkin.

  A discussion at the dinner table around an hour ago:

  **Dad:** ""All blacks are thieves. Say a black guy stole your house from you, does that not make him a thief?""

  **Me:** ""Yeah, it does.""

  **Dad:** ""Well, there you go. They are all thieves.""

  **Me:** ""So... if a white guy stole my house, then all white people are thieves too right? Or if a white guy fucked his own mother, then all white people also fuck their mothers too right?""

  **Dad:** ""I don't know what you're talking about. You can't just take one person and base everyone on their actions.""

  **Me:** ""Ugh... that's exactly what you just did.""

  Then he just goes off topic and avoids it. By the way, he has black friends who he treats well and does not say bad things about them.



  If he hears my wife or my mum swear he puts on this sickened look and says ""You know, it's not lady-like to swear. It is a turn off."" He does this a lot. One time I went to the pub for drinks with my wife, my dad and work friends (dad and I use to work at the same place). My wife swore in front of my colleagues and my dad shamed her in front of everyone about swearing and how woman should not swear. He then went on, in his next breath, to imply I had anal sex with my wife in front of the same people. I am not talking about subtle either, it was along the lines of ""Yeah... so your dick was in her arse"" or something like that.

  He thinks everyone around him is a ""complete and utter retard"". Nobody is better at anything than he is. If my brother or I do something that is considered a good job, he will bag the fuck out of us. My brother and I finished off a retaining wall that dad was too lazy to finish himself. As soon as my dad saw it he started yelling about how shit the job was. This was out the front of the house. On the street. In front of neighbours. Loudly.

  He has no social skills. He will openly bag woman, races, and anything else in front of company. We went to my favourite restaurant a few years ago to celebrate my 25th birthday. My dad asked the waiter for fish and chips. The waiter politely told him that if he ordered the fish and chips it would not be a filling meal as it was on the children's menu. So, you would think he would happily choose something else or order two or three of them. Nope. Dad told him he wanted nothing. As the waiter was collecting our menus, dad (loudly) mumbled what ""a fucking retard"" he was and how shit the restaurant was. He sat there in silence and had a pissed off look on his face. Ate nothing and said he would never go back.

  We went bowling once... that was fun... They had the lights dimmed down and music playing. You know, sort of night club bowling for a bit of fun. Dad went and asked the guy at the desk to turn the lights back on as it was difficult for him to see what he was doing. When the man told him on Friday nights they have a disco and he is unable to change it, my dad came back and started throwing the bowling ball down the lane. All you could hear was clanging and banging from the ball ruining the lane. I mean, this fucking thing was spending more time in the air than on the lane. I'm pretty sure his best throw landed the ball a meter or so away from the pins.

  My uncle had a barbeque the other week. One of our female relatives got her phd. Dad sat there praising her about how proud he is and what a great job she did. As she was explaining what a phd was (due to dad askign her) he kept making facial expressions that translated to ""hurry the fuck up and get to the point"". Around 30 minutes later he was telling everyone (35 people) how slutty woman are and how they take advantage of men.

  There is a lot more stuff but I will leave it at that for now since it may be enough information for you guys to get an idea of his character. If you need more I am happy to share.

**tl;dr** Racist against black people but has black friends. Hates woman but is married. Acts like a child and preaches how people should act like adults.

I've been in therapy for 2ish months now for chronic depression and a somewhat shitty situation I live in. I've been ""adultified"" (I'm only 17) and because of this role I've gotten into the habit of hiding my negative emotions: my depression, irritation, anger, etc. My therapist keeps telling me we need to talk about feelings, and I know she's right, but I'm still having a hard time. Like, I'm seeing her again on Friday. I told myself that we would talk about feelings, but I told myself that the last 3 sessions. She gives me plenty of chances too-asking me if I'm ready to talk about it yet, and if not we talk about my day/week.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I never really planned on sharing this, but I feel if I don't get it out now, I never will. 

All my life, i've been a loser. Clumsy, fearful of pretty much everything, bad at school (even gym class) and mentally weak. This is how i've always been, or at least how I remember myself being since the age of 6-7 years old.

I've never been great at making friends, so I spent most of my childhood a loner. I've also never been great at keeping the ones i've managed to make because of the emotionally unstable part. 

Now, when I say i'm emotionally unstable, I don't mean I have anger issues, abuse others or break down into dramatic scenes. It's more of an internal ""shut down mode"" that turns me into a self-hating hermit. One day to the next, I basically lose all willingness to love myself, much less to go out and interact with people. I can't bring myself to work or do anything productive. It's like my brain won't allow it, no matter how much I try. These ""episodes"" can last for months.

Aside from this, I fear most things. For one, I fear responsibilities. Not because I don't want them, on the contrary, I would love them. But I don't trust myself enough to be able to accomplish anything right. I am clumsy and horrible at everything. I also suffer from anxiety every time I leave the house. I am constantly worrying about what others think about me, to the point I don't even want to be seen. 

This means I can't advance professionally or be independent. I'm in my early 20s and I want to go out there and live. I want to be normal like everyone else, but I can't. 

I'm an illustrator and people tell me i'm great at it. I have people wanting to work with me and offering me opportunities, but I fear I can't deliver. 
How could I? One day I'm motivated and happy, the other I hate everything and have no creative output whatsoever. Seriously, how could I ever make money from it and support myself if I can't be constantly productive? I have tried to fight through it, but it doesn't work. All that happens is I get frustrated and waste time, sometimes up to a month. 

I'm just so lost and I don't know what to do. I see myself becoming a homeless person in the next few years because of this. I have a passion to live and create, to reach my goals and break boundaries, but fuck. My brain won't let me. It never has.

What should I do?

I don't feel depressed as much from actual events or people (things that would make sense to be upset about) but instead am upset about what is within the five senses. Colors, sounds, smells, and especially touch, upset and overwhelm me. A strange color arrangement or a sticky, hot feeling might make me feel sick. I'll have suicidal thoughts over this, and I can't control them. It is very hard to explain.

I also think I am mentally retarded and ugly and stress over grades and my relations with people. Despite this, I don't get anything from people anymore. Talking doesn't help me resolve any of my conflicts or feel better. People are insignificant to me, not because I disregard their well being, but I just don't get anything from them or being alone.

My mind also does this weird thing where I will see strange images in great detail. They are so abstract that they don't really represent anything at all. It's like a pleasant organization of the senses that I usually get sick from minimized. I don't actively think of them to create them, meaning there's no previous thought linked to their action. They just pop up.

I don't know what that is. I don't know how to treat a disorder where I am upset by something so primal and essential as the senses. I don't have many good things going for me, and I didn't at all when I was younger, so I do not know what to do. Even if I had everything, I would feel as though I have nothing. I don't know what to do before I can't form sentences anymore or control my emotions.

It took 12 years but there is was. One of the main things that I have going is videos. Whereas schizophrenic people hear voices, I see videos in my head. Those videos fall into 1 of 3 catagories. What was, what could have been, and what could be. 

The what was are usually clips from things I've seen, either on film, tv or sometimes from my imagination based on books I've read. Always tame.

The what could be is usually the what if questions. What if I had done this back then instead of that. Mostly tame.

The what could be is where I veer off into the bad. Always, the videos I have of what could be involve violence and laughter. I see the video clip in my head, then I laugh out loud or giggle. Do you know kind of weird looks I get when a guy my size giggles like a little girl?

The content of the videos is graphic. I hope this this attaches the NSFW tag.

MOST of the videos are triggered by something(I still don't know what) and contain violence. Not the punch, beat people up violence either. 

Take today. Cut off in traffic. I had to resist the urge to follow the guy home because I immediately saw myself ripping his arm off, and beating him with it until he stopped moving.

Most of my what could be videos are like that. Some are more violent than that. I've spent 17-18 years controlling myself so that I don't do that sort of thing. I've gotten quite good at it.

So anyways, back in 2009. The chick I saw prescribed me Abilify 20mg 3x a day. For the first week, didn't really notice a change. But then, it was like night and day. The videos were gone. My brain was silent. And I cried. I never felt so alone in my life before. I hit rock bottom, I didn't want to leave my room. I flunked out of college. I nearly lost the rental house. I didn't want to do anything that I had loved doing before. I think I cried more that 6 months than I have in the rest of my life. I was only on it for 6 months because that's when my wife at the time lost her job so we lost insurance. No more Abilify. The videos came back. I felt whole again.

Part of me wants to get better. I want to have a real relationship. I want to feel like I belong. I want to be, for lack of a better word, normal. 

But then again, part of me is scared. Scared that they'll take the videos away. Scared that I'll be alone for the rest of my life.

She also recommended I see a psychiatrist for medications, which I told her I am cautiously open to. 

My question is this: after only an hour, without even a definitive diagnosis, is it too soon to already get prescribed medication?  In other words, is it normal in the world of mental health for medications to be prescribed based on symptoms and not based on an actual definitive diagnosis?  Or is this a case of just throwing medications at the problem to ""see what sticks""?  Is this just the nature of the beast, that it is going to be a trial and error type of approach or does it make sense to narrow down the diagnosis, because that might allow for better choice of psychiatric medication?

I confided in my friends about the situation, and they do not think I have a problem. Yet, I can't help thinking that I MIGHT be mentally ill. 

My ex often hints that I have been abused as a child even though I have reassured him many times over that I have not. His words are really offensive, but he won't stop telling me that I was abused and need to seek help. Only people who deny it are the people who have serious problems. I grew up in a well-off, happy home. My parents constantly tell me they love me and encourage me to find happiness and success. I don't know why he keeps on bringing up the issue. Maybe I was abused and repressed it deep in my memory somehow, but I can't see or fathom it. 

However, I am quite reclusive. When I am with company, I am quite social and talkative. But I'd much rather be at home to cook, do crafts, and watch television. I do have about four or five extremely close girl friends who I hang out with once or twice a month. My ex says that I exclude and alienate myself from people. He constantly points out how socially awkward I am, and he says that all his friends feel weird around me.  He says that I am a downer and change the mood. When I am with MY friends or interact with people without my ex, everything seems really normal. Everyone is happy and laughing when appropriate. I never get an awkward impression from people, but I may be oblivious to it because I DO have a problem. Am I overlooking other people's reactions because I have a mental problem?

I have trouble opening up to him, and he also attributes that to my alleged past abuse. Whenever I do open up, he gets angry at me for feeling a certain way. He says that I have made his life miserable. I don't want to bring problems up, which he finds troublesome. My feelings get bottled up, and I become extremely passive aggressive. I shut down, give him the silent treatment, or become extremely impatient with him. I know this behavior is bad, but I am scared to tell him my true feelings. I feel like I have to censor myself around him and not discuss the fundamental problems about our relationship.

We had an argument about him smoking in my car, and I do not like breathing in smoke. I took his cigarette away, and he lit another cigarette and threw it at my face. I went back to my car in tears and told him that he was going to regret his actions. He took my car keys and called the police, alleging that I was ""trying to commit suicide."" I am not suicidal, nor have I ever thought about suicide. Far from it, and to have him accuse me of something so serious and involve the authorities, I don't know what to do anymore. 

He says that I have a high pitched voice because I was sexually abused as a child. He sometimes clasps his hands over his ears and tell me to change my pitch. When I do, he tells me that I am tone deaf and need to change my pitch, not my volume. His words are extremely hurtful, and I shut down. I don't talk to him and give him the silent treatment, and he says that I am being passive aggressive again - a symptom of borderline personality disorder because I am trying to control him emotionally.


He says that I have BPD because I am overly sensitive to his words. I am admittedly an extremely sensitive person, which concerns me. 

For example, he missed a concert because I did not pick up my phone on time. He sat in his desk continually whining, ""____ is my favorite artist of all time. I could have seen him, but you made me miss it."" Every few minutes, he would groan, ""___ is probably on stage right now."" I told him that because he told me an hour before the actual event, there was probably no way we could have gone any way. I did not like the way he was blaming me, so I left. 

We did not talk for almost an entire week. Not wanting to deal with him, I decided to make summer plans on my own. I later texted him the day before his final exam to tell him that I was going to visit my uncle in Florida. He then blamed me for emotionally abusing him and playing with his emotions, such that he could not study at all and failed his exam. He says that I was being manipulative and have a serious problem. In my head, I knew that telling him that would trigger his anger and lead to a fight, but I also justified it because I have a right to leave the state whenever I wanted. I was not doing anything wrong by visiting my family. I know I was wrong, but is this a sign of manipulation and BPD?

I broke up with him last month after he called the police on me. He told the police to have me in custody and perform tests on me; irked, the officer told him that he had no basis to take me anywhere and there was no proof that I was suicidal. 

Yesterday, he called me laughing without any context. I then told him that talking to him was not pleasant anymore, so I would like to stop communication. My voice was cracking, and I was extremely serious. However, he laughed (genuinely) even though I did not say anything funny. I was being extremely candid, sad, and serious. He continued to laugh and say that I was silly. The laugh (to me, in my head) was really eerie and inappropriate. He said, ""he's respect my wishes for now"" and hung up. 

At this point, I know our relationship is toxic, such that I need to leave.  But now, to move forward, I need to work on myself.  I can't tell if the problem is with me (having BPD) or with him (having no signs of BPD but a history of Xanax abuse, weed addiction, and heavy mushroom and LSD use.) I don't want to gaslight him and blame his behavior on his possible drug problems or maybe he's really just a jerk. I can't tell. Maybe I devised all this in my head because I am the crazy one.

TL;DR. I think I might have BPD, but can't be sure. Help with advice please. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Will someone help me figure out if I am going crazy?

Just for context, both me and my friend live abroad (away from each other), her sister lives at home with their parents. As far as I know, they all have a terrible relationship with their parents, it's not a good home environment. 

My friend text me during lunch, told me something had happened and wanted to talk at night (which was a couple hours ago). So, her siblings back home had called to tell her their sister had ""lost it"". Apparently last night, one of her siblings caught her out of her mind trying to kill her cat (which she loved). He took the cat away, she bit him, proceeded to ""sit on the floor chanting religious stuff"", followed by her trying to jump out of their apartment window. 911 (our equivalent) as called and she was put in a mental facility. She believes she's been chased by ""something"" (spirits or something). According to my friend, her sister had expressed suicidal thoughts before, had low self esteem (even though she showed otherwise), would sometimes go violent verbally for no apparent reason with her close friends, and would also have an erratic behaviour. I have no idea why no one looked into it before. 

I've only met this girl once years ago, and there's nothing I can do for her. What I can do, is be there for my friend. She is not okay, despite saying she is. I'm worried about her. She's the kind of person that keeps her feelings to herself, and even though she speaks about it like it's something trivial, that she just never thought her own sister ""was crazy"". But they are close. I want to be there for her, but this one of those times I don't know exactly how. I've never been in her situation, never had a sibling go through something like that. I do not know how it is to be in her position and I'm not pretending I do. 

So, what I'm asking for, is advice on how to be supportive with my friend whose sister was hospitalised yesterday. I want to ""be there"", I just don't know how, or the best way to do so.

My services are all being paid for by Medicaid at the moment, but it appears that they may not continue to cover them because I haven't been making measurable progress despite attending far more than the typically covered number of sessions. 

Measurable progress means my scores over time on the [PHQ-9](https://impact-uw.org/tools/phq9.html) which is in my opinion one of the most useless and vague screenings I have ever taken. [Here is the PDF of the assessment itself](http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/images/res/PHQ%20-%20Questions.pdf) 

My scores were something like 14, 16, 17, 19, 24, 24, 22, 19 since July of last year (roughly) and those 24s and 22 were all measured atypically close together (all three within like 6 weeks as opposed to monthly or bi-monthly) while I was taking Strattera for the first time for my adhd. The most recent 19 is with more Celexa and no Strattera both as an attempt to manage the 24s. Im probably a 16 or 17 today.  

Unfortunately Medicaid doesn't look at why the scores got worse only that they can use that information to determine that the services being rendered aren't successfully treating me and therefore should not be continued (or covered). 

This is very frustrating and stressful for me because I actually think therapy IS helping me. It's not drastic or without setbacks and I have a whole bucket full of issues and a bathtub full of exacerbating circumstances to deal with. 

I told my therapist that therapy is like cleaning out a very full closet. I've been shoving your issues, emotions, memories and everything else into this closet for years and pretending that the closet and its contents just don't exist. Now I have actually decided to deal with The Closet and all of the Stuff inside because I need that headspace to function and I want to experience emotions healthily. So like any major closet cleaning/reorganization the first step is to stop putting things in the closet. Second is to start pulling things out of the closet into the rest of the room. I have been not putting things in that Closet for almost a year and I have slowly been pulling the Stuff out into the rest of my head/room. 

Obviously the room looks a whole lot worse once you've stopped adding to the closet and have begun pulling things out to deal with them. Obviously my depression is going to be worse now that I am not ignoring/running from/shoving away my emotions/issues. Obviously looking at the Stuff in the closet is going to be difficult and cause me to feel more depressed and anxious. 

So here I am with a room full of stuff and maybe 30% into this project and I am facing the possibility of no longer having the time/help/company/accountability that allowed me to even do this much. 

I am supposed to figure out if there is anything I/we can do that would be more ""effective"" on paper that would enable me to continue to get the services I need. Different therapist? Different group? Different meds? Different counseling center all together? 

I have worked really hard and pushed myself to go to all of my appointments, to remember all of my time commitments (not always successfully) and to keep on trying to get better despite seemingly constant setbacks and nearly indiscernible progress. 

I just needed to rant/vent/share with someone who might understand or who has been through a similar situation. Any and all support or advice would be appreciated. 

**tl,dr: PHQ-9 scores are getting worse not better over the last year due to medication changes (presumably) but as a result, Medicaid claims that my therapy isn't working and shouldn't continue (or be covered). I do think it is working because sometimes you have to make a bigger mess in order to clean.**",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Therapy ""Not Working"" and needs to be reevaluated. adhd-c, depression, x-posted, long post, looking for advice etc etc etc."

There are multiple volunteers for the event so I personally may not get to speak, but somebody certainly will be doing so. For any of you who suffer from mental health issues yourselves or have somebody close to you that does I'd recommend attending. It's a good festival anyway even if you don't come to speak with us!

I put a tl;dr at the bottom because of how long it turned out to be.

My mom's last partner, and the dad of my younger brother, was abusive. Most of it was directed at my mom, but I got caught up in it sometimes. He would call her names, take cheap shots at hitting her, and didn't really leave his room that much, the room where he would either do drugs or play video games. I remember him slashing his back and the sides of the door frames out of anger once, and he 'accidentally' threw a mallet head at my mom's head (he was an asshole, but not dumb, I don't believe that he decided to swing an old rotten mallet about and not intend to hurt anybody/break something) which sent her to the hospital, she still has a scar actually. Hit her right in between the eyes. 

He poured cold water over my head because I wet the bed once (ironically, from a cheap 'best dad ever' mug), and also intentionally threw a huge leather beanbag at me when I was around 5-6 years old. They broke up a few times, and the police were called a few times too, but he didn't leave until just before I started high school.

*God*, high school. I 'go' to an all-girl school, and they were all snarky and pretty catty. For the first year I would usually go in with greasy hair because I was scared of having a bath/washing my hair (will be explained) and they wouldn't let it go. I still went in with it like that on/off for the last few years, for the same reason. 

The popular ones would talk about me behind my back (literally, that's how the desks were set out, they thought I was deaf or something), the overall class just tried to ignore me and would whine and complain when they had to do-group work with me, one of them gave me concussion a few times because she didn't know her own strength. 

The school didn't do anything, and made me apologize to the one that gave me concussion. While all of this was happening, my attendance was gradually starting to get worse. I couldn't go, I just couldn't. I couldn't stand it, the atmosphere, the expectations, the anything. I just couldn't. I felt like if I went, I would get in trouble for something and be yelled at, the overall atmosphere of people expecting things of me and judging what I did all the time was too much for me. The last day that I went was May last year for the end of year exams, which I did okay in for somebody with shitty attendance. 

I can't go outside anymore, it just feels unsafe. Like something really bad is going to happen to either me or the people I'm with when I go outside, I can't stand it.

And there's something else. I don't really remember it ever starting, I acknowledged it as being abnormal in Year 4 when we went on a school trip to somewhere for a week. All the other girls in my dorm were fine with using the showers, sleeping in bunk beds and not having the adults near by, and it was so weird to me because I couldn't cope with any of that.

I've always heard voices, just in general. Talking among themselves, humming, sighing, talking to me, ect, just there all the time. They aren't people that I've heard before, they just call me names (slut, whore, dumbass, worthless, pointless, dirt, the like) and tell me to kill myself. If I walk down the street and there's a car driving past, they'll tell me to jump out in front of it. They might just tell me to lay in the road or something. Whenever I have baths they always tell me to drown myself because I'm worthless and pointless.

And I see things, 3 different things. I don't really want to explain what they are, but they're there. They don't really do anything, I don't mind them to be honest. I mean, I don't want them to be there, heck no, but they're not a direct issue. I know that none of them are real, including the voices, I think I always have, but they're just *always* there, they never shut up.

The next problem is really weird, I don't really know how to explain it, sorry if it's confusing. Sometimes I'll sort of forget where I am, like, I won't recognize the things around me. If I'm in my room, I'll remember seeing my stuff from somewhere, but I won't be able to decide what they are, what they do, or who they belong to. I just feel really out of touch with what's going on and start to feel homesick and scared, usually I start crying and go to sleep, and then it's sorted itself when I wake up.

I live with my grandma because my mom can't cope with both me and my brother, and I've told both of them this. I've been in touch with a mental health organization since the bullying started, and I told them everything, but it didn't go well.

The counselor was rude, stuck up, couldn't stop interrupting me and just made me worse. I can understand asking ""So, what do you want us to help you with? What do you think we can do to help you?"" in the first meeting but... that's all she ever really asked. I don't know, I'm not the mental health professional, I don't know what they can/can't do, and she never really told me what was possible when I asked her either.

I tried to change counselors, but they refused. I talked to a psychiatrist after that, she interrupted me just as much. She blamed the things I see on 'tricks of the light' and said that the voices were my thoughts. I said that they weren't, and she insisted that they were. I can tell the difference between my own thoughts and them, and there's a huge difference.

I agreed to see the counselor again because she said she would try to change how she talked to me, but then they decided out of nowhere that I wasn't co-operating and stopped talking to me. They arranged a tutor for me, I've got a second one now who's nice, and they also arranged.. multisystemic therapy? I think, I don't know, something like that. 

They more or less said that they can't do jack shit to help and I'm now being referred *back* to the first people.

I can't do any of this at all. I can't cope with all these people, I can't cope with people always coming into my house, I can't cope with people in general, I just want to die.

I've been so close to doing it, too (which they know about) I was so fucking close to just overdosing and getting it over and done with at one point, I had the pack of pills in my hand and I was so ready to do it. I still am, I still want to, but then again I don't want my grandma to have to find whatever's left. I self harm, it's not that much and it's rare, and she nearly fainted when I told her about it. They don't know about how close I was to overdosing, though.

It's been 3 years and I still hate myself, I still can't go outside, I still want to die, and nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen with anything and I can't cope with it at all. I've been to the hospital twice because of me wanting to die already, they didn't do anything, they just talked to me and told me that they weren't allowed to say anything official and sent me home.

**TL;DR:** Grew up with a verbally abusive step-dad and watched him try to beat up my mom with MS several times, I was bullied in highschool and it destroyed my self esteem, I see things that aren't there, I hear voices telling me to kill myself all the time, and I want to die.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"What's wrong with me?

For the past couple of months I have been experiencing episodes of sudden and extreme fatigue in the absence of any medical conditions - diabetes, meningitis etc etc. It became apparent to me that most of the time these episodes would come about when I thought about it. As such I've theorised it's probably some form of panic disorder or something. Lately the symptoms of these episodes have become far more pronounced and it honestly feels like my mind is completely severed from my body. 

Today, for example, I was lying on my bed and I noticed I was almost completely numb, for want of a better word. I was there and it felt like my body wasn't my own. Of course I know my arms are my arms etc etc but they just feel foreign. And this feeling has occured previously where I have been worried about collapsing if my legs gave way or something like that.

I read this quote in an article (""http://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/transcripts/relationships-with-abusive-narcissists/"") that matched my situation exactly: 

""You will be required to deny your self: your hopes, your dreams, your fears, your aspirations, your sexual needs, your emotional needs, and sometimes your material needs. You will be asked to deny reality and ignore it. It is very disorientating. Most victims feel that they are going crazy or that they are guilty of something obscure, opaque, and ominous. It is Kafkaesque: an endless, on-going trial without clear laws, known procedures, and identified judges. It is nightmarish.""

Every year at around this time I get very sad. I don't know if its depression or not, but from October through till May I am fine, then come June I bottom out. I have felt *it* coming on strong over the last week. Last year I skipped it somehow, which was great, but this year it seems to be back really strong. 

I'm sleeping whenever I am able, whenever I am home. I would like to be asleep all the time, i'm so tired and apathetic, but I'm also constantly switched on, very alert, but kind of spaced out, just floating. Everything looks strange and foreign and frightening, kind of surreal. I am paranoid and guilty. Very guilty, over imagined things, thoughts. Paranoid about making mistakes. I'm on the verge of tears all day at work, and when I get home I just cry and go to bed. I feel empty one minute and full the next. I've begun to self harm, which is something I haven't done in years. I don't know what to do to head it off - I know it gets much worse than this. It hasn't responded to medication previously, to therapy, to self medication, meditation, spirituality, to anything. It just sits in me until the end of September and I have to deal with it.

Can anyone suggest a way to address it, or lessen it, because the thought of feeling as I do now, maybe worse, for the next three or four months…I can't put myself through it, or my family, but I don't know what my options are, what optionsI have left. I've tried to manage it and seek help before, but nothing helps, and I have to wait until I feel it lift.

I am scared. I am not drinking or using any drugs. I still get up and go to work, meet my responsibilities and familial commitments, eat healthy, go for walks. This takes a lot of effort, but I know I need to put the effort in. I've gotten better at running on autopilot through it, but at the same time it's not something I feel I have control of. 

It all started with a fit I had at school when I was 16, which has been explained to me as an anxiety attack. Prior to that I had no issues with depression or anxiety - I was a thoroughly happy child, decidedly average -  a good kid, although throughout primary school I had to see some kind of child specialist three times a week for guided relaxation sessions (they were organised through the school, why I don't know, my parents were never notified or involved).

It seems more and more clear to me that this is something I have to learn to live with. If I could ride it out I would - I am a resilient and independent person, but this wears *me* down so much. 

I'm not looking forward to a life in which this plays such a large role. Everyone in my family, on my father side, experiences a similar thing. Some manage it successfully, some use a lot of drugs and/or kill themselves. I don't know if what is happening is due to mental illness or my personality.

I have had a fear of my reflection since I was a teenager. This started with not liking the look of myself, moved on to avoiding it and now it has been at least ten years since I looked at myself properly (ridiculous I know). I catch glmpses in the occassional unexpected mirror in a shop etc. but I react quickly and shake them off without really registering.

I'm 28 now and realising more and more that this is stupid and want to shake it. There's a mirror just to the left of my desk but I can't ""just do it"". 

Why am I so hesitant? I know I'm not attractive but I'm just not sure how bad it is. In a lot of ways I think that I could be doing the right thing: I don't have insecurities about my appearance, I'm not really held back by being unattractive, etc. So things might take a turn for the worse when I do know. On the other hand it is pretty inconvenient: I can't style my hair or facial hair, I have to grab certain seats in certain situations, if I have anything on my face it could be there all day before I wash. So ironically I could probably improve my appearance a bit if I was willing to face up to it.

Anyway, I was thinking that I would book a short session with a psychiatrist or councillor. I don't know how I'll react when I do it, I've lost a bit of hair and probably look a lot older than I imagine myself. 

Not as serious a condition as most of the posts here I understand, I'm just posting to lay out my thoughts really. However, if anybody does know of any specific support groups or has any advice then please let me know.

Couldn't decide if /r/anxiety or /r/depression is the right place for my question, so here seems to be that nice happy ground. Do let me know if either would be more appropriate.

I'm based in Sydney, Australia and my psychologist, while messageable, won't get back to me until Tuesday. My previous dealings with my local hospital for mental health weren't the greatest for my anxiety, so here I am, trying to work out if I need to get my butt to hospital.


My mental health has steadily worsened over the last couple of months - I have PTSD and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I haven't been able to actively participate in my hobbies, mostly due to physical exhaustion as a result of anxiety attacks. I stopped going out aside from errands and a convention about three weeks ago when a suggestion a friend made for meeting up triggered my PTSD symptoms. My stress levels have also been through the roof due to finances... A lot of anxiety has stemmed from being absolutely powerless to do anything about it.

I've been struggling far more than usual to try and function at a baseline level. I barely brush my teeth, showering only really happens out of being ashamed of my greasy hair/stinky or trying to calm the fuck down, and my eating has been really haphazard.

There are only four reasons why I bother getting out of bed at the moment: needing to pee, fiance kicking me out of bed, being asked to run an errand or because my phone battery is dying and my charger's in the lounge room.

In my psych session the other day, I found myself expressing that I don't want to be alive, as there's no point. However, I'm not self harming, not in immediate danger and not at risk of harming anyone else.

The last time I was at this point, my psychologist told me I was borderline and that hospital was an option for me. However, the one time I ended up in the emergency department for my mental health (was low-medium risk), they decided against hospitalising me as they felt that it wouldn't help my social phobia (which was part of my diagnosis at the time).

Do I need to be checked into hospital? If so, is this something I can arrange without seeing my psychologist or my GP? If hospital doesn't seem appropriate, what are my other short-term treatment options? ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Do I need to go to hospital?

I have this switch where ""emotions"" only come when I want them to, but are otherwise ""off"". I feel little to nothing when death is involved. I value logical conclusions and tend to scoff at emotional thought processes. Finally, my moral compass is very close to non-existent as long as the cost/benefit ratio is in my favor. On the other hand, I value kinship, respect, and social justice. If I feel like reading something sappy or tragic I can use that switch to experience the same emotions as anyone else. So I'm curious as to what to call (if anything) this grey area between sociopath and mentally healthy.

I've been looking, but I don't know which organizations are really worth a damn or if there are any out there that would really give someone like her a chance. So many won't look past the track record. So I need help finding those organizations. If you have one that helped you, one that you know is really good-hearted, those are the ones I want to talk to. 

TL;DR. My friend has been to hell and back and I want to help find her a job at a not for profit that helps people so she can see the worth in life again and get out of our god-forsaken town.

I have tried everything to help but nothing is working or won't go the way it's suppose to. I've become very depressed due everything that has happened and cannot sleep at night properly anymore because I am sick to my stomach about everything. I am sorry in advance if nothing make sense...I am crying hysterically and just don't know what to do anymore after what has happen today.

I've started noticing that he would cover the computer camera...I didn't pay much attention to this at the start because even I was pretty paranoid about those things. So I dismissed it....then I've noticed his increase intake in weed. I've known and so did my parents and we tried to get him to stop...In the beginning I thought this was just a stage that every ""normal"" teenager would go through. I was wrong...completely wrong when on his 19th birthday he decided to smoke up in the backyard while my father was in the house and then later drank a couple of beers when friends came over. I was there, my fiancé, best friend and my father to monitor everything...we didn't want them to get shit faced or anything. His friends lived next door so they were not driving. WE didn't know he smoked up...he didn't seem unusual nor did he smell. We just wanted him to enjoy his 19th birthday with his close buddies. But then about 2 hours went by my brother disappeared. His two closest friend didn't know where he was and we started searching for him. One of his closest friends found him in the washroom barfing his brains, half naked, and making absolutely  no sense. I've never in my life seen him like this. My fiancé, best friend and I had to dress him back up clean him and get him to barf Everything out. Apparently mixing the two is NOT a great idea and really fucks you up. His closest friends got very upset because they have specifically told him not to smoke weed and warned him about what would happen. He didn't listen and still did it. THIS scared me, my fiancé, and my two sisters. Thing went downhill from there...my mom and brother don't exactly get Along all the time because my brother doesn't like how my mom can be controlling of everything...so this one day about a week after his birthday my brother and mom got into a very heated fight. My fiancé and I thought that we should tAke him out with us and go to my sisters and her partners house. So we did and we got to my sisters house and chatted and talk till my brother became very serious and quiet. He told us how he sees the number 69 everywhere...he has said that he sees it in the ying yang, in his birthdate, his name. He has also said that he thinks people hacked into his computer (we later on found out that he thinks it's my sisters husbands 90 year old grandfather that did this.) My sisters and I sat with my parent a told my parents our concerns...obviously they've noticed the same but were hesitate to get him to the hospital. Things got worse, my brother started seeing things, like blood coming out of a tree and thinking there's a dead body in our backyard...he needed to investigate as he told me when we were both alone. I got scared, took my dogs and my sisters dog and locked myself in my room because he had a saw in his hands, pacing back and forth saying that he swears to god that he was going to kill. He wouldn't tell me what he was talking about so i locked myself in the room. I called my sister panicking and told her what was going on. She came 20 mins later and spoke with him and he was fine. My parents also spoke with him and he said that he was ok. My fiancees mother is a nurse and sent me directions to the closest hospital or recommended hospitals to send my brother to for mental illness. Next day at 5 in the morning, he was in the backyard again starring at the tree. He was up since 4 in the morning....My mom got scared, didn't know what to do and left to go to work crying...leaving my dad and I at home. When my brother came back inside, I went up to talk to him and asked if everything was fine and he said no. So I calmly asked him if he wanted to go to the doctors to see if they can do anything to help him. He agreed. Called in both my jobs and told them I wasn't coming in, called my sister and my mom turned around to come back home to take my brother to the hospital. 

We used the recommendation that my fiancés mother gave to us but turned out that they only took clients through emergency....my brother refused to go through emergency so we went to camh about 10 mins away and they kept him for 1 night and said that since he didn't show any signs of suicide (and he told them that he had suicidal thoughts) or anything that they cAnnot force him to stay since he is over 18 years old. We Took him home....next day my mom and brother went out....he started talking about flashing lights and dead bodies. My mom got scared and went into the nearest police station to ask for help. The police officer said that he definitely need to go to a hospital or anything that has to do with mental illness. Took our name and number and said that a doctor will come to our house in a week to speak with my brother. Next day, my brother took my fathers keys and disappeared for 2 hours....My mom happen to drive by the same police station the day before and saw my brother going into the police station. I called the number they gave my mother and asked if he was there and they said that he was...apparently when he got there he told the officer that he wanted to go to the hospital that he's having suicidal thoughts...and there response? They directed him to the nearest hospital....they didn't fucking take him because they said he drove himself to the police station perfectly fine. My brother soon after came home and I told him that I was taking him to the hospital. He was there for 3 days and declared that he was clean, had no hallucinations and that he was fine. The doctor said that she did not believe him but because he wasn't causing any harm to himself or wasn't acting crazy that they cannot force him to stay. They had also mention that if he does come back that he will lose all rights and will force him to stay. He said fine. Couple of weeks go by he said he had suicidal thoughts again....he is now taking anti depressants....but it doesn't seem to be working. This past week he's been sneaking out, taking the car, coming home late, and lying where he was. 

So Today, my mom was trying to take a different approach. She thought maybe if she allowed him to take the car once in a while and wasn't so hard that he'll open up...SO he took the car today. About 20 mins later he was driving quite fast into the drive way. Parked, and ran inside very pissed off. About 10 mins later a women came crying saying that my brother was driving so fast, went through a stop sign and ALMOST hit her 8 year old daughter. My heart stopped, my brother came running outside yelling at this lady telling her to leave, that she doesn't understand, that the airplanes were following him. She became scared and apologized and begged my mom not to yell at him or beat him. My mom told her that she will not that she is thankful that she came and that he has not been himself. The lady again apologized, hugged me and said it will be ok. My dad had to forcefully lift him up into the house. Yelling went off, brother punched a hole in the wall for the 5th time probably and screamed and told us we won't understand. I've begged my parents to take him back to the hospital, or I could take him but my mom now believes that he is not mentally ill....that there's actually someone pissing him off. HIS CLOSEST friends don't talk to him anymore. He has no job, no money to buy any kind of drugs. And he has no motivation to find one...he makes every excuses in the book to not apply. Either it's too far, he he knows people, or it's bitch work...anything! I haven't noticed anything been sold...no jewelry missing.

Reddit, we've done everything. He isn't covered by insurance anymore and we've asked our doctor to give a note to the insurance to see if they can put him back so we can get him to a physiatrist (sp)....we are still waiting and now he is refusing to go back to the hospital. He screamed and yelled and my pRents don't want the police to get involved. Does this sound like a mental illness reddit? What can we do? What are the next steps? I don't feel safe at home...I can't sleep...I cannot function anymore...I've lost all motivation to do anything. Please help. Also would it help that we live in Canada? I would like to mention that during his stay at the hospital for 3 days...they found no drug but weed in his blood. He also get these mood swings and breaks things...about 2 days ago he hammered his phone, two days before that he punch and broke his lamp. He has multiple time punch hole into our walls. We have no family history of bipolar, schizophrenia or any kind of mental illness. We do though from my mother side suffer from depression and anxiety. My mom, and both my sister and now brother are on anti depressant...I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible. We all including my brother have been diagnosed with dyslexia, and ADHD. Brother has severe dyslexia and mild ADHD and I have mild dyslexia and severe ADHD. Sisters are basically the same.

I have a friend (M 20) who has depression.. going thru tablets..counselling...

on some days he appears ok .. gets up..showers.. plays video games..eats etc. On another days he wont leave his bed.. it seems to be up and down.

But what concerns me is that he's spoke a few times about wanting to die (usually on bad days).. and he has this bizarre theory that he cries about.. 

He believes that the world is over populated with too many people. That nobody really cares about anyone other than their own friends or family (inner circle).. and also talks about how food will run out soon.. so we are all going to die anyway.. So he might as well die now to make it easier cos he cant change anything, and cant make people compassionate. &lt;--- that's literally what he says.. He's so cut up about the over population thing it baffles me..

Is this something that many people feel when struggling? could it be more than depression?.. I'm struggling to understand but I want too.

I don't really know where to post this, and really just looking for some outside opinions. I think I have a fairly active mind and am constantly analyzing situations and just really anything, but after awhile of I guess you could call it inactivity to society, I'm kind of getting to the point of questioning my existence, where it just feels like I don't exist, like I almost feel seperate from my physical self, it's kind of difficult to explain. I usually have random bursts of anger, and have inflicted harm on myself before, although not serious for a while, I also get very easily frustrated. I try to avoid social situations whenever possible, anything that would make me feel uncomfortable I will go out of my way to avoid, no matter how small they are. I am constantly stressed and worried about pointless things. I dunno, this is just kind of a venting post, I don't like to burden people with my issues, this is the first time I have really said any of this to anyone. So basically any opinions on anything would be amazing, advice on how to deal with the stress, anger, confusion. I don't think I'm depressed, I'm often happy when I'm around people I like, but then I can rapidly change my mood dependent on situations.

I've never had a definite sense of self, and as I go through life I seem to pick up mental illnesses. As a teen I was legitimately depressed, but I also think that I caused it myself by thinking/wanting to be depressed because I was convinced by media that that's how teenagers are. Then as the gay rights movement became publicised I suddenly felt like a lesbian and was attracted to women. I wasn't doing it for attention since I never told anyone but my best friend. But I still felt bad/ostracised, like what I imagine legitimately gay people feel. During that time I also developed social anxiety after reading about it, it went away after a round of antidepressants. I still feel it sometimes though. And two years ago, I had the thought that I might be trans (FTM). I ignored it, knowing about this tendency of mine but now I keep getting gender dysphoria episodes. I have to mention that I was reading trans subreddits during that time and I felt drawn to the ftm stories. So now my mom got on my case about my love life and I told her that I don't plan on getting married. She keeps mentioning having kids and 'just finding a guy to impregnate you'.

I've always known that I was slightly different than my peers. I've always felt less, been a little bit socially awkward, more daring and bold, more desperate for attentions, and always a bit smarter. I'm trying not to sound arrogant, but I want to accurately represent my mental state.

I've always been a rebel. I grew up in a very religious family, but I started questioning that around my 12th birthday. By the time I was 15, I was experimenting with alcohol and tobacco and whatever else I could get my hands on. I left my parents house not too long after that . I continued being socially awkward up until I was about 18. That's when I really started noticing behavior patterns and social cues. Since then, it's been relatively easy for me to fit in and be the life of the party.

I won't say that I've never felt love, but I've never felt the overwhelming feeling of love that people describe. I've always had difficulty expressing love as my partners have wanted me to. I've been described as cold and detached. I don't get excited for life events of other people. I view them as minor achievements that don't really mean much in the grand scheme.

I myself am relatively successful, make decent money and have all the friends I could ever need. My friendships tend to be short lived, however. My longest ongoing, active friendship to date is about 4 years. I do value my friends, but I don't know how much of that is emotional. My grandma passed recently, and I remember not really feeling anything.

Since I was 17, I've had my fair share of run-ins with the law. Nothing major, but I've come close.

I'm quick to anger and have a fairly awful temper. It's caused issues personally, but I can usually walk it off at work.

I'm fairly certain that I'm not a sociopath, but I feel as if I could be a psychopath. I've been putting off creating something like this or seeking professional help for a while now since I feel as if I can overcome any issues on my own.

Whatever issues I have are affecting my current relationship. It's mostly due to how cold and unemotional I am, but also because of my anger and my lack of remorse when we fight. I never feel as if I'm in the wrong. I can tell (after the fact and reflecting on the rush I got from the fight) that sometimes I'm being more of an a-hole than I should be, but I never feel wrong.

I've taken a couple tests online (but we all know how accurate those are), and they all seem to point fairly strongly toward psychopathy.

My questions are:

1) Does it sound like I have a mild form of psychopathy?
2) Does it warrant treatment, or should I just try to be more aware?
3) If it warrants treatment, is there a non-pharmaceutical option (I view drugs as a bandaid)

In 2012, one of my sisters best friends went missing, and a large search effort called ""Help Find Linnea"" was started. Unfortunately, this didn't end happily: huffpost article about the ending. She was one of the nicest people I have ever met, and I am not exaggerating or embellishing. She was smart, she cared about her community, and she was going to UC Davis. As the article stated, she started to breakdown at Davis and started to suffer under severe depression. She was at an therapist's office and her parents were going down to meet her when she walked out, as the health care professional could not keep her there as they did not deem her as a danger to others or herself. She disappeared, and you all know the ending.
Her family is now trying to make sure no other family will ever have to go through that terrible experience again. With the help of state legislators, they're trying to push through a really simple bill that has a very good chance of succeeding. This bill, AB 2198 will require all incoming mental health care professionals (and I mean all) to undergo 15 hours of vital suicide prevention training along with the rest of their education before they can receive their license. All current professionals will have to undergo 6 hours of suicide prevention training to renew their license. Those hours can seriously save someone's life.
But how can you help get this passed? It is amazingly simple. All you have to do is call this number: (916) 651-4024 (Senator Hernadez). Say that you are calling to express your support for Assembly Bill 2198 (keep in mind this bill is for California). They will take your name and zip code, and you'll be done. You'll have helped.
Linnea and her family relied on a therapist to help diagnose and help her mental illness like you would rely on your doctor to diagnose and fix appendicitis. The health care profession was her safety net, and it failed. This bill can patch up this hole in the net. It can prevent other suicidal teens from taking their lives. We just can't let this happen again.

I am looking for some advice on whether or not I can and should do something to help a woman that I know. 

This is a throwaway, here's the gist of it:

I work at a hardware store in the Pacific NW. A mentally ill woman frequents our store. She suffers from the delusion that a boyfriend and his ""associates,"" have been stalking and harassing her for close to a decade. She claims they do things like spray poison down her chimney, soak her laundry in urine and generally break into her house and disassemble the countermeasures she has deployed to prevent intrusion.

I know this because my supervisor has been working for her on the side for a few years. She pays him to modify her house to be impervious to intrusion. All of her interior doors are screwed shut will L-brackets, and her front door is barred.

He passed this off to me when he didn't really need the extra cash. 

Since my first trip over to her house I have been interested in getting her help. She heats her house with an electric oven because ""they"" hide in the vents. It takes almost five minutes to get in or out of her house. her house suffers from basement flooding, black mold, and rotting wood. She has shrines with prayers about the eventual death of her stalker ex and her freedom from misery all over the place.

I want to help this woman if it is possible but I don't know what I can even legally do. Or what I can do that couldn't backfire on her. She is a practicing addiction counselor. 
 
I don't know her family. I don't know if she had friends. And I haven't done any work for her in a while now, but she came into the hardware store today and might ask me to do some work.

After it seeming to get louder, I stepped outside to see if I could find the kitten. I find the kitten, it looks just like the kitten I saw about a week or so ago that I had wanted to keep, so I try to coax it to come up to me. It keeps meowing, so I go inside, get a little piece of chicken and come back outside to see if I can lure it. After a little while, it starts coming up to me and then goes towards the stairs (the outside stairs, I live in an apartment complex), so I sit down to show it I won't approach further in hopes I won't scare it away and this guy walking by stops, noticing me making little sounds to try and lure the kitten.

I point to where the kitten is meowing and he says he can't see it. I figure he can't see it because majority of the kitten is black. At this point though, I was a little confused that he can't hear the kitten's meowing since it's fairly loud, so I get up to point out the kitten and when I approach, still seeing the kitten meowing while sitting there, I turn to look at him, confused he didn't see it previously since it seemed like it would've been in plain view for him, but when I look back to the kitten, it's there one second, sitting, and then it just disappeared, like some sort of messed up magic trick. The guy at this point quietly walks away. I felt pretty spooked and mortified. But even after the fact, I still stood there, hoping there really was a kitten there.

I've been a bit stressed out, but nothing crazy. I'm not on any medication, I don't do any recreational drugs. I've been diagnosed in the past with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but I've only really had psychotic features intensely hit 2 times in my entire life and neither were something like this where I honestly thought a cat was there. Both times I saw or heard things, but I was 100% fully aware that it wasn't real. This time... I had been outside for a good 15-20 minutes I'd say, before that guy came along and was trying to coax this non-existent cat. I've always heard of hallucinations (those that people THINK are real) being out there things, like maybe a talking animal, something very off in that manner... but not something so realistic as a meowing kitten? 

Are hallucinations like this also common and just not stated as often as the super strange type? What do I do now?

Around middle school, I became seriously obsessed with this one girl. Like, I would write poems about her during class, give her chocolates every Valentine's Day, and just sort of hover around her constantly. This obsession grew for about four years, and then one day I decided to face my Juliet and profess my undying love for her. 

Given the fact that we were way too young to be thinking about things like that, she backed off hard. I completely understood that I came on as creepy, but the sorrow just knocked me out with a Sad-Falcon-Punch. For a month I just felt no reason to live, as my sole purpose in life had just abandoned me. 

Fast-forward to high school and beyond, and I haven't felt the slightest attraction to any of the girls. I've actually been approached by a girl or two, giving me their numbers. Haven't called a single time. It's like my ability to love was numbed down. Couple that with my temperament issues, and I just don't feel right anymore. I don't even hold feelings for the girl; she moved shortly after middle school. So uh, what's wrong with me?

**Background**: I have a psychiatrist I trust, and I have been in his care for talk therapy and meds for six years to treat my major depression and my generalized anxiety disorder. Any replies I get in here will not be construed as anyone online giving me medical advice, but they will help me direct a future conversation with my doctor. I earned my Master's in psychology in 2000, so I can ""talk shop"" about many mental health issues, but it's much harder to apply that knowledge to myself. It may be worth noting that I also carry an Asperger's diagnosis.

**All categories of diagnostic criteria except, perhaps for the first one.** I have never been abused. My parents were great. I've never been threatened with violence. My father just died of cancer, but my symptoms have been going on for years. 

So many intrusive memories, flashbacks to ""little (emotional) traumas"" that then trigger physical responses that can last for days, avoidance of things related to emotional traumas (like breakups with old boyfriends, even though I've been happily married for years, or seeing the names of former colleagues who majorly screwed me over), many ""negative alterations in cognitions and mood,"" and 4/6 of the ""alterations in arousal and reactivity."" 

**It is possible** that 9/11/01 could have been an initial triggering event for me. I was working with kids at a psychiatric hospital at the time, and one of our patients had lost someone in the WTC. I had to accompany a 10yo girl to the ER for a rape kit when she was first admitted. Those kids suffered through some horrific forms of abuse that might qualify me for the ""indirect exposure in the line of duty"" part.

**But it's not just the 9/11 anniversaries that set me off**, or news about people hurting kids, or women getting raped. I'd just given birth to our son when Hurricane Katrina hit, and that song about renewal ""Tonight's the Night the World Begins Again"" was played all the time in the fundraisers that followed...I burst into tears at a Goo Goo Dolls concert  last year when they started playing it. A former friend of mine was exceptionally cruel to me in the recent past, and when a song played on my husband's CD in the car yesterday, I had a flashback to sitting across from that friend and hearing that song for the first time as the friend sang along with it. I nearly had a panic attack in the car, and remember it last night in bed had me sobbing into my pillow so much that I had to get up at 3am and turn my computer on to type up a letter to that friend that I probably shouldn't send but probably will anyway.

Could it be PTSD even if the flashbacks and other symptoms aren't necessarily triggered by anything remotely connected to my time working at the psych hospital? **I feel like it's existential trauma, but I don't think that's a thing.** I just want to know if it's an avenue worth exploring with my doctor since I've been going back downhill after having gotten better for a while.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Does PTSD have to have a specific triggering event?

They control you

Up so high

Soar to the sky

Come crashing down

From smile to frown

And everything in between

The cause of which is still unseen

Wonder how it came to be

Praying for consistantcy

Wish there was some sort of cure

A place in which to feel secure

Wish there was some sort of hope

Too much conflict from within

Not sure how to do this, so I will explain my symptoms(reasons I am here) followed by my past:

1. I have had a reacurring dream for the past 12 years that is causing me increasing stress. I dream I am in a plane with my father, mother, sisters, ex-fiancée, and my grandmother/father. The plane starts to jump around. We all put on parachutes and jump. I am the last one out as the plane explodes. All of us land safely and begin walking towards some 4x4 off road cars. As we walk, the ground turns into mud, then into quicksand, but I am the only one effected. They can't hear my calls for help, nor stop to see my struggle. Then, they all drive away and soon disappear in the distance. I wake up sweating and sometimes shouting, everytime my eyes were wet. I had been crying in my sleep.

2. I have extreme emotional stress and sudden depression when I hear the song by R.E.M. ""Losing my religion"" on the radio(happens every now and then). I know, very weird/random.

3. I have random moments where it is hard to breathe(anxiety?), chest begins to hurt(like heart ache). No trigger. Last time I was at work studying CCNA 1.

Now the really long part, my past:

I had a normal childhood until around 8. I was in a car accident with my mother. We both were taken to the hospital due to minor injuries. My mother immediately after the accident abandoned my family(father, my 2 older sisters, and I). My father told us kids she had died in the car crash. Later I found out he had done this as a way to make it easier for my sisters and I to cope with. He thought it would be easier to accept that she was dead rather then she didn't want to be our mother. Over the next few years my father became physically abusive and addicted to drugs, my grandparents took my sisters and I in while my dad got straightened out. Fast forward 9, my father is remarried adding a younger step sister and younger half-brother. My sisters were back in contact with my mother without me knowing. One day they ask me to go with them to run some errands, being bored during the summer break I accept. They drive 20 minutes into a neighborhood I had never been and say they were gonna see a friend real fast. Going into the house there is my mother. Confused, and shocked, I demand an explaination and get one. During those 9 years she had gone north, remarried and had 2 more kids. I was beyond angry, hurt, betrayed(not just by my mother but my sisters and father as well), and felt rejected. The reason they brought me here, my mother wants back into my life. I told all 3 of them to go f themselves and to leave me alone. I left and ended up walking home(took me 3.5 hours, I remember that walk VERY well). Over the course of the next 2 years I ignored my sisters completely as well as began to distance myself from them as far as family goes. My mother made another attempt to get me back into her life. She got a hold of my cell number and called me a few times. The last time I spoke to her I said I wanted nothing to do with her and my stepmother was more a mother to me then she had been. The next day she killed herself. To this day(12 years later) my sisters tell me it was my fault she did that. Needless to say I do not speak with them and have never meet their kids(2 nephews and 1 niece).

Footnote issues that maybe linked?

-My ex-fiancée left me after 6 years because she felt I just didn't want to be alone and didn't love her.

-I recently got engaged to my girlfriend of 5 years and had to explain somethings to her parents to not talk about to my folks when they meet.(My gf's mother asked about my mother, that's what prompted the footnote version to her folks)

I have also never confronted my father. I felt what he did to protect his kids was right.

In an effort to channel my frustration, I'm seeking out things to do but it's not working. I have half a dozen unfinished art projects, books, and activities strewn about my apartment since I can't find the patience to do anything. Everything is boring me. I am so incredibly BORED and it's EXHAUSTING because my mind is racing!

Backstory:
I've struggled with depression for several years, coming to a major climax at 22 as a college Senior. It's been uphill since then, I've been doing fantastically and just managing my ADHD. I've been trying to start a career, had a great job in broadcasting but got bored after a year. It was making my depression so bad, and managing my ADHD was difficult as I steadily lost motivation. So, I left...and didn't need my meds for the first time in 2 years. Got another job working for a college (after some time being happily unemployed) where the atmosphere is lax and more accepting. Overall an excellent place, and no meds! However! While I feel better working for the college, I feel myself getting SUPER unmotivated again. That same nagging slope of losing my drive and attention, and feeling my thoughts wander to rash decisions about quitting and traveling the world. I've been getting moodier, snappier, fatigued, and more irritable. I'm beginning to lose interest in my hobbies again because they can't capture my attention. It's getting harder to get work done, and I feel bad for my partner due to my crazy mood swings. One second I'm spewing out great ideas and ecstatic...and the next I'm sulking in bed kicking myself over not doing something...hating myself for not being able to get my shit straightened out. 

I have discussed being bipolar with several doctors, and 2 out of 3 agreed I was not. I do not think I am either, although I can see why some would.

FYI as of typing this, which took forever,  I have half of my toenails clipped because I lost interest. SIGH. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My ADHD is exhausting me. Or maybe I'm just unhappy?

I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist awhile back.  I should've started way sooner than I did, but better late than never, I suppose.  Anyway, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, OCD traits, generalized anxiety disorder, excoriation disorder (which I think is related to the anxiety and on the OCD spectrum, if I understand it right), OCPD... I don't know if any of that is relevant or not.  Anyway, I went for about a year, give or take.  All was going fairly well, I was making improvements.  Well, at one point I was having a rough time of it, and in a state of ""fuck everyone and everything"", and stopped going.  And I haven't been back since.

Things were ok for awhile, but it wasn't long before it was back downhill again.  And I'm at the point now where things are really bad, my anxiety is getting out of control, the BPD is REALLY becoming an issue, and I'm pretty much hating my life (no, I'm not suicidal.  I stopped trying that about 10 years ago).

I really want to go back to my psychiatrist and my therapist and get better.  I'm so sick of feeling this way.  I can't take it.  But the last time I went was about 2.5-3 years ago.  I've wanted to go back for a really long time, but I'm so terrified that I'm going to go there and they're going to be super pissed off at me for leaving, and yell at me, and basically tell me to fuck off.  I know in my head that they won't yell at me, but I'm still scared.  And I'm scared of them turning me away.  I just get panicky at the thought of how badly it's going to turn out that I can't get myself to walk into their office.  But I really need to.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here.  Advice?  Reassurance?  Has anyone else been in a situation where they stopped going to their doctor and went back way later and it all turned out ok?  Are they even allowed to turn you away?

I have a Doctor appointment tomorrow morning (in 4 hours because I can't sleep..) and one thing we will be discussing is a rehab facility for people with depression, anxiety, eating disorders and so on. So essentially you go and it's like a dressed up hospital where you share a room with someone you don't know (anxiety hit number one) I am curious about it but I'm also terrified as fuck. I hate being alone, I hate big cities and I'm scared of change. Many family members and even my Dr has pushed the idea on to me.

I'm in a committed relationship for over 6 years. I live with my girlfriend, who is working full time. I am studying and my parents pay for everything.

From a young age, I was identified as intelligent. I was able to read two languages fluently at the age of 7. I also knew how to use computers to play games, create documents, etc. The first few years of school were an absolute breeze. I never learned how to study, or felt a need to. I cruised on the strength of my general knowledge and intelligence.

High school was a little harder, and I had to actually study for things every now and then, but I always resisted it and did the bare minimum. I ended up getting low to average marks for some subjects by the time I finished high school, whereas I should by rights have gotten high marks for them all.

At this point I should note that from about the age of 12 or so, the end of every semester signalled a fight with my parents. My marks were *always* lower than they should have been, and my parents would be upset and try things like reducing my allowance or banning me from playing games. It never stuck.

Straight out of school, I went to study music in the city (my parents live in a town 50km away). I stayed in a student dorm. Around the second semester, I started sleeping in late, missing classes, and just playing games in my dorm room. Didn't really socialise. I failed my practical at the end of the year due to never practising.

The next year, I continued music (and repeated the subjects I had to). I lived in a house with a few friends. My behaviour got even worse; I skipped class far more often (probably because I had to take a bus to get to school), and at the end of the year, failed the majority of my subjects.

At this point, due to my dreading the coming fight, I forged a report card out of desperation so that they would think I passed everything. However, somehow (I forget), they managed to find out about my real marks and were understandably livid.

By now, I was in the relationship I spoke of above.

The year after that, I lived with my parents, and began studying sound engineering at a sort of ""career college"" type of thing in the city (I took the train in most days, or sometimes caught a ride with my dad). This went really well because the work was so trivial; I wrote most exams without studying and got 70+.

This course took me three years. Once or twice I failed a subject due to not submitting required projects, but I was always able to resubmit work and pass. To be fair, I failed to submit a *lot* of stuff, just because I couldn't be bothered, but somehow they would pull a mark out of the air for me.

After the first year of sound, I moved into a flat in the city with my girlfriend. My parents were paying my rent, but I got to stay with her. This was awesome, but it meant I kept having reasons to want to skip class. My girlfriend has a history of depression (few suicide attempts), self-harm, and anxiety, and early in our relationship we'd established a pattern of me dropping everything to care for her. We've managed to break out of that mostly by now, especially since she's mastered her depression.

After finishing sound engineering, I realised there were no jobs (though I also didn't look very hard). My parents were also unwilling to kick me out into the world with just an advanced diploma (a fraction below a bachelor's degree) in a silly trade. So they encouraged me to go study electrical engineering. From a young age I'd expressed an interest in computers and electronics so it made sense, and I thought maybe I could somehow combine my skills in sound and engineering to build a cool career.

So I continued to live with my girlfriend, and started a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

I'm still busy with that course, and I've failed several things. My parents have given me ultimatums. I'm supposed to pay back my course fees for the subjects I've failed, but if I'm honest, *I can't even remember what I've failed*.

My marks are being released tomorrow and I don't know what to do. I've spent the last two months just not going to school at all - dropping my girlfriend off at work and then just coming straight home to play games. I've ignored a call from my programming lecturer (by this point I've switched my course from electrical to computer systems) to come to an exam. I got an email from my systems analysis convenor saying I can write the exam I missed if I bring a doctor's note, and I ignored that too.

My parents and my girlfriend believe everything has been going fine. They've asked me repeatedly throughout the term if everything is okay, and I said yes - at first because it was the truth, and later because I couldn't bear to tell them I'd missed a class, or two classes, or got 50% on a test, or abandoned school entirely.

I saw a therapist for a bit end of 2012 (I think). He diagnosed me with ""generalised anxiety"", which I think is a huge understatement. I believe I suffer from

* anxiety disorder
* depression, possibly seasonal
* ADD or ADHD (a questionnaire I filled in with the therapist suggested a 70% chance of this)
* social issues - perhaps just social anxiety, perhaps autism spectrum, perhaps sociopathy or something severe like that
* compulsive lying
* other compulsive behaviours (picking at my scalp, biting my nails)

I've got a few skills - I've taught myself programming since before I started engineering. If I look at entry-level jobs I don't have half the technologies under my belt yet, but I am a fast learner. I think I could get a job in software development, but I don't have a relevant qualification, so it would require an employer to give me a break - and I don't know how to get that foot in the door, since jobs here always start with a CV.

I don't know what to do. Part of me is panicking; part of me really, really doesn't care. I've meant to write this post for over a week; couldn't be bothered. I know I should be freaking out and thinking, oh god, my life is over; but I don't feel it. I just feel calm.

EDIT: TL;DR:

* Boy genius, never learned to study
* 2007-2008: skipped classes, failed degree, parents mad
* 2009-2011: did lame sound engineering course
* 2012-2014: did engineering, failed lots of stuff, lied to parents about it
* marks released tomorrow, parents will know I failed, shitstorm

I've always been convinced that I would develop schizophrenia, I don't know where that one even started I know it was amplified after a very bad auditory hallucination episode. I'm still very convinced of this and become terrified by the slightest hallucination. 

I convinced myself that every little pain is something serious,which causes me to ignore every pain, and makes me convince myself that I will die from thinking a real serious pain is not serious.

I'm convinced the shadow person in the church my dad makes me go to is out to get me, and the whole reason it's even there is because of me. Which I still believe and have become even more paranoid of lately. 

I'm convinced my dad will die in a car accident, don't remember how that one started. 

I believe that if I think a negative what if enough it is doomed to happen

I easily get convinced that someone is out to get me

Last night I was very convinced something disastrous was going to happen because the thunder sounded weird, the cat was meowing, birds were chirping at 1 am. 

I was convinced I would gain the ability to shapeshit throughout most of my childhood 

5th/6th grade I was convinced I was part wolf ""because all the signs pointed to it"" I also belied i could summon dragons

4th/5th grade I believed I had small psychic abilities because my ""what if thoughts"" were often true I still think this is possible but no longer completely convinced.

Anyways,the examples go on. I'm still convinced some of these are true, other I know were probably silly. It's really annoying though, these things causing me to be paranoid all the time. Any advice for dealing with these things?

No I'm not trying to sleep with her, she's a lesbian.  At the moment she's got no one else.  All the people she knows are addicts.  She's on a direct path to prison or worse right now.  She's trying to get to a friend's house across the country to get clean and away from everyone she knows right now.  There isn't much of a plan on how she's going to make it there or options.  It took me a week to put the pieces together, but I came to the conclusion that the underlying problem here is a mental health issue.

She confirmed this when I asked her about it.  She's got documentation from the government about ocd, anxiety, adhd, and bipolar disorder.  She has some medication for these conditions, but I don't know what she has or if she even takes it.  She has/is also selling some of her medication so I know she's not treating whatever disorder that's for.  She also has memory problems and differing styles of speech that I've noticed.  I don't want to say more than that and point you (falsely?) in the direction of another disorder I'm thinking about. 

She's got to get out of here though.  She's in a shitty hotel, trying to sell her stash of illegal drugs to raise the cash for her trip, I believe the management has noticed the traffic, to me it's just a matter of time.  If she doesn't leave she's going to wind up in prison.  Everything has to be her idea, she will not listen, she will not compromise.  All of her worldly possessions, about 3 car loads, are in that room too.  She wants to rent a moving truck and leave.  Her license is expired and she doesn't have the money to rent for a 1000+ mile drive.  I think she plans to rent for an in town move and take off.  I don't think she realizes they track their vehicles and she won't make it.  She's relying on a photoshopped paper license to get the rental.  Which could work, but that whole ""plan"" is quite the longshot.  It seems more likely to fail to launch or the rental company reports the vehicle stolen once they notice it FAR from the agreed area of use and shuts it down.  At which point she would likely be in the desert and start walking.

She has a sister that lives in this city.  She got out of my car and ran off on foot, 9 hours later I picked her up, she had been heading to her sister's house on foot in 95+ degree temps already emaciated before she even stepped out of the car.  I couldn't believe she was ok when I found her.  I took her over to the sister's. I waited in my car while she went inside.  I did not hear the conversation, but she told me that she told her sister she had been on IV drugs for two months and had attempted to OD/suicide.  I was more than a little surprised they just let her walk out the door.  The sister sent a semi-concerned text, but that was it.  I want to go back there today by myself.  However, I don't know what I'm expecting to say or accomplish.  My ""fantasy resolution"" would be to explain that this girl needs help with mental health and drug addiction.  Then their family would come together to get her into treatment somewhere tonight.  I just don't see that happening after taking her there the other night.  This girl looks terrible and it's all fallen apart in a couple months.  I wish I knew what was said for sure or the past history.  I just can't believe family would see her in that state and just let her walk out the door and leave with a complete stranger.  Jesus, I'm trying not to cry right now just thinking about it.  She walked out the door slowly and calmy, not in a rush, not trying to ""escape"" from someone trying to make her stay, in tears.  I sat there for a few seconds expecting someone to come out and at least say something.  I was shocked, I fully expected them to take one look at her and take her in.  I was expecting her sister or brother-in-law to come out to the car to tell me thanks for bringing her by, she's going to stay there, we're going to get her help, blah blah blah.

So reddit, ideas, thoughts, subreddits???  The last couple weeks have left me stressed, sleep deprived, and out of ideas.  She says she wants to quit, has made remarks about suicide being the solution if it has to be, I believe she wants to quit.  How can I help?  

She's a veteran with an honorable discharge.  She's also a felon for drug related offenses.  In my eyes she's not the typical addict like the friends I grew up with.  She's someone with mental health issues that's self-medicating.

As far as who I am so you can judge my observations and perspective.  I'm early 30's, college educated, WAS (yay recession!) a business owner for 8 years, my father is an ex-con, I grew up in a lower middle class suburb where more of my friends would go to prison than graduate from college.  Three of my four best friends growing up would become meth addicts.  Two of them would die as a result of actions from that lifestyle.

He talks and talks and talks like he's high on cocaine and in a great mood one minute, the next minute he's literally crying, curled up in a ball and talking about how everyone would be better off if he were dead. He's called off of work TONS  of times just because he didn't want to go. He feels worthless all of the time. He's never happy, not for more than a few hours anyway and it's always followed by days of severe lows. I feel like I don't even know him anymore. And don't even get me started on sex, I forgot what it is. He doesn't do anything anymore, he just lays in bed all day every day unless it's one of those rare occasions he's inexplicably euphoric (or high from abusing meds) and not sleeping for days. He's abused medications (prescription and OTC) and alcohol just to get away from feeling like he does every day. This week he had somewhat of a mental breakdown and finally he decided he needed to get inpatient care, so he checked himself into a hospital an hour away as a crisis case and is now there for an unknown amount of time. We didn't know what else to do. He has a therapist, he has a psychiatrist, and he takes plenty of meds for anxiety/depression but nothing has been working. I haven't seen any improvements at all, in fact it's getting worse. It hurts me to see him hurting and when he gets into his really bad bouts, I hate that I can't make him feel better. I try, but often I don't know what to say or how to handle the situation. 

I don't really know what I want here. Maybe just someone to say they've been here too, or they know what I'm going through or they know what *he's* going through and can help me figure out how to help him? Maybe just a hug, I don't know. I just need to talk to somebody. The person I love is not himself anymore, and if something doesn't change, I am afraid he will commit suicide. Living with him has gotten harder and harder, not because I don't want to be here or because I love him less, but because of all the stress and me not knowing how to handle him and everything just feels so wrong. I want it to be okay again. I miss the person I fell in love with, but even though  I see him every day, I haven't seen *him* in a long time.

""I think (more like 'know') that there is something mentally wrong with me""

Now, I've had that sort of realization in my head for a very long time, only this year it getting to a stage where I can't ignore it. One thing I would like to say is I don't fully know how to explain and write the whole 'story' behind my whole 'problem', I just don't know where to start so, I will try my best to type the important things I guess, but if you have any questions about anything then please ask (That way it is easier for me to explain things, if I am doing so as answers).

Anyway, here is a summary of my mentality.

.When I was 7 years old, I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression. All I could remember about the whole medical stuff, was there was no clear reason for my depression and I was put on some pills for a short while (these pills didn't really do much though, I assumed that because I was 7 they just gave me some weak stuff). Also, according to my parents I showed some depressive symptoms before I was 7 as well.

.Until I was 9, I saw a couple Psychologists/Medical-people-of-some-kind, there was 1-4 that I may have only seen once, and I had to go see a school counselor for the whole of that time period as well.

.When I was 9, I was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, I had just a general OCD of just miscellaneous things (mainly washing hands, but anyway), with the Anxiety I never knew what the general specifics for that was (Also, no real reason why I would possibly have these things). 

.1-2 Years go by, and I've had to seen many different types of 'doctors' such as Psychologists, Therapists and Psychiatrists, (even got a brain x-ray once..), I then got very sick of seeing all these different people, because 1. I just didn't want/like talking to all these people, and 2. I didn't particularly like talking about what I was feeling to these people (I don't even remember what I was feeling).

.After just pretending to agree and get better to all these people, I finally did not have to go see any, anymore, except the school counselor but I never talked about anything to them.

.Fast forward a few years to Year 7, from what I can remember I was always feeling 'unwell', like I just didn't want to go to school, so I had many days off.

.In Year 8, same situation, although increased, however I start feeling just more 'down' and not caring as much, and I also started falling asleep in classes.. (For one I just don't have a very good sleeping-habit).

.And then now in Year 9, I've started feeling much more down, to me the best way to sum it up is 'depressed', and not only that but these 'depressed-periods' are very random and they are very heavy and bad, there has been many times I have had suicidal thoughts (never plans or proper motivations to do so) but thoughts.. and I did cut my arm with a knife a few times, not for attention but I guess, as a release?

All these emotions and the only ways I can explain how they feel is like.. I want to just scream out all the time, and I mean just properly yell out.. and most nights I am left feeling just so bad like my chest is just compacted in and it all just hurts.

And I don't know why. I just do not have any clue why all this is happening to me, all this pain, all this ""emotional-outrage"" I feel when I am alone, and then when I am in public settings all the almost ""neutral"" feelings I show and have. I feel like I just need to know what it is so I can have a little closure, like I just want to know whether I do have Depression, should I take meds? (Because I just can't find the energy/want to go to talk to anybody), do I even have Bipolar? (Because although I don't behave in any obvious signs of being manic, I do have  a lot of bipolar traits, like moodswings and so on..)

And just, I know that if I want to find these things out I should go get a psych evaluation, and to do that I need to ask my parents and then just.. I just want a person to say something about this, I have never told anyone all of this in bulk, because I'm too scared that it's all in my head..

The thing is, people who know me would find it hard to believe because to them in terms of this, I seem very reserved and easy going and I am, but when I'm on my own, where It's ok, I feel like my emotions are screaming in agony.

I'm sorry if this post is confusing, or just weird, or things were left unexplained, ask any question you want, I just am finding it hard to write this like it for some reason is worse as I keep typing this, I don't know how long I will keep this post up, I just don't know.

This isn't much of a problem because since I have experienced most emotions, I can ""simulate"" them so well no one has noticed. The only thing I am really ""worried"" about is when I get into a relationship. Since I can only feel the slightest of affection and irritation, I can't love someone in a romantic way.

Sometimes I can understand it but other times I cannot. Rarely it has suddenly ""shouted"" a word at me, that I was not thinking of beforehand. More often I will hear the TV in the loungeroom, however I'll hear it in the middle of the night, go into the loungeroom and nobody is awake and the TV is off. Rarely I will get a voice that commentates lightly what I am doing (outside of my own thoughts.) When I hear the voice/s, they only last an hour or two and then do not happen again for weeks or months.

I hear the phone ringing a lot during the day but I go to get it and it is not actually ringing in reality. This has caused me to miss many calls because I thought it was in my head.

At work I cannot bring myself to leave my food or drinks in the shared fridge because I worry that somebody will poison my food. If I see a part of my food that looks unusual I cannot eat the food because I become convinced that somebody is trying to poison me. I cannot eat anything if it has an 'unusual' or 'unexpected' smell, because I start to think that somebody has defecated in the food. I cannot eat it. I can look at this and realise it is probably silly, but I cannot say to myself ""Dont' be ridiculous"", because I still think ""Well somebody may poison me""

I once saw a cluster of UFOs and have been frightened ever since thinking that aliens could see me and they know who I am and where I go. I felt very exposed at the time of seeing them. I keep my bedroom curtain pinned closed at all times because I am scared of someone or something looking into my room at me. I have extreme issues with going to sleep, I get sleep paralysis with hallucinations (once thought I saw a terrifying alien in my room) and I have to close my cupboard doors and leave my lamp on all night because I simply can't stand the fear of the darkness. It terrifies me to my core and makes me break into a cold sweat and have heart palpitations.

I have always been a smart person, however I feel like I do things and move very slowly. Every mistake I make, makes me feel like an utter idiot. I feel that I am the most stupid person in the world. I feel that everybody knows me as 'that stupid girl"". Some things I have done I can't believe how stupid they are. Mistakes or saying something that makes me seem totally dumb. It makes me really sad and cry thinking everybody hates me. I don't talk to people if I can help it, although I work as a cashier so I have to talk to customers.

I have an issue where my brain decides ""If I do this task a certain way, something bad will happen/&lt;name&gt; will die"" etc. For example, when re-stocking the drink fridge at work, and I have 2 bottles in my hand, I have to put the left hand bottle in first otherwise my mother will die, or I will get sick or something terrible like that. It makes it extremely difficult if I am forced to do someething the ""wrong"" way, because if that bad things happens it will be MY FAULT because I did that action wrong.

There are many others things that I cannot think of right now. A lot of paranoid things. I feel like I am overreacting but these things do happen to me and they must mean somethting. Thanks in advance

**tl;dr  I have lost it**

Edit: My mother once lashed out and said that I ""never smile"" and walk around like ""creeping jesus"" which upset me. She also claims that I speak without inflection, so I try hard to do that when speaking with people

Edit2: I once came home late at night, parked my car and while still sitting in the vehicle, in the corner of my eye I saw a black shadow where there should have been nothing (it is just grass, and then the road of my quiet street), so I turned and looked at it, it looked like the height of a fire hydrant and it was a shape or figure with a ""hat"". It was all silhouette. I looked back at my steering wheel, then thought ""What the fuck was that?"", looked back and it was gone. I was shaking even after I had run into the house.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I am having anxiety, paranoia and hallucination issues please help"

 I am trying to not make a big wordy post about how everything sucks. I have always had anxiety and minor bouts of depression, but I was functional. I had a job, home, and a relationship and was semi confident and happy. Fulfilled I guess you could say, I had pride in myself. however early last year I felt the depression coming up and around the sound time I was feeling burnt out from work and my relationship. I tried to keep going for almost a year, I never stopped caring for my partner but one day I just felt different and I still don't not know if that was my choice or the growing depression, as slowly all the things I enjoyed and cared for lost appeal. They were just there. Eventually the relationship broke down mutually, I felt I was not being fair to my partner. But that left me without the emotional support I was used to and I spiralled into a even worse state.

For the last first 8 months I had

* Growing lack of enjoyment

* Doubts about how I felt about things, which constantly whirred in my head

*Constant heavy feeling

I obviously was diagnosed with depression, have since tried various meds Citalopram (on for 8 years), Mirtapramine and Lofepramine.

Since the break up I was an even bigger mess.

*Constant anxious thoughts, could not stop blaming myself for my good life falling apart. and missing my ex.

*massive tenseness

* Short tempered

* I am unable to still feel anything positive, in fact it is worse. I don't feel joy or excitement or passion. Which is making it very hard to motivate myself to do anything or create goals. Because I worry I wont enjoy them,or I do them and feel nothing. I just want to rush home, but then there I dwell and the environment is not healthy.

* This relates to emotional connections, I find it very hard to connect to people now. I can chat and be fine but it is like they are not real. Not my world. When spoke to I can be very inattentive and distracted by nothing.

* Because of the lack of connection to things, i feel like I don't care about anything.

* I am unable to play or enjoy games, tv or films. I cannot focus on them for any length of time. If I do attempt them I have to do many things at once, so miss most of it, It is the only way to focus, by not focusing.

* I am sad and unhappy, and desperate on bad days, on better days I am just blank and empty.


I should be starting therapy in a month or so, and I will be going back to the doctors next week (takes weeks to see my doctor). I was told I was on a waiting list which would be 6-8 months (for a suicidal¬.¬) A week or so ago i finally got a letter from them asking me to call and confirm I wanted on the waiting list. 6 Months for a confirmation! Now I am on the waiting list but it is likely 6 months +. Found another low cost option which should be starting much soon, but it is volunteer counselling and cannot prescribe anything.

I am wondering how to approach this as I don't simply want another med increase, I know people cannot diagnose me. I am doubting if it is just depression, I doubt it is bipolar or adhd, maybe a more extreme anxiety disorder or trauma. But I don't feel human, alive or part of the world. I am just numb and a shell of who I was.Something must explain the focus issues. The meds I have treat anxiety as well but I feel they do not do enough.  I have found in reading that it really helps to be proactive with doctors in asking for other avenues and tests. But there are few tests I know for mental health issues, I may request another blood test but the last few have never shown anything. But I have heard there are other things that can be tested for and am thinking of compiling a list of suggestions.

I am tired, so tired of this now, I want to be alive again. I used to be someone, whole, fulfilled, now I am impatient to do things again but cannot. I am fed up of going to the doctor with a few ideas and having to direct things myself, he is better than any doctor I have had but I feel if it was physical then I would have a million tests done on me. 

Any suggestions of what to mention to test for in bloodwork or any tests/ideas people have had done themselves would be very helpful. I need to speed this thing along as I cannot keep dealing with this mess 24/7.  I normally give meds at least 6 months trial, am I waiting too long before seeing the doctor? I am not sure if it makes a difference but I am UK nhs based, things move slower than private it seems.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I need to work out how to get the help I need by being proactive with my Doctor

I tried kissing my ex while she is engaged last Christmas. It was wrong, I was acting selfish and feel shitty now. The one I was dating, I messed up and tried rushing things, having sex too soon.

Things seem so topsy-turvy now and I dont know what to do. Looking for advice and wondering if my vague idea that she has high-functioning BPD is CLOSE.
Here are the signs. I'll start with the marriage:

* Binge-Eating and Purging
* Continual issues with body weight/image 
* Having an affair *Having no 'boundaries' during fights, e.g. telling me that committing suicide would be better for our family, mocking my family history of depression, mocking my parents divorce, things like that. I didn't respond in-kind to her issues of binge-eating and purging * Sudden, intense shift in the last year towards getting in shape and massive change in daily schedule resulting in seeing our children much less. Met a man at Marathon training. Runs marathons constantly, training for triathlon.

During the divorce:

* 'Hacked' my email - She knew the password, but after I found out about the affair, she wanted to see what I was 'thinking'. This was, I felt, a massive violation of privacy. 
* Saw emails between myself and parents, and when she realized they were upset with her and 'abandoning her' emotionally (due to her leaving me for another guy and divorcing me) she became enraged with them 
* She took out a restraining order against me and forced the Sheriff to remove me from the house, as in an email I told my father I had no plans to leave (this was in a fully peaceful way. There were absolutely no threats or violence involved. Restraining order is given ex parte, meaning you don't get to present your side: she said she was afraid of my reaction to the divorce) 
* I didn't see my kids for 22 days afterwards

Since then:

* Things are INCREDIBLY peaceful. Our divorce has been so smooth and easygoing. *She's dating again. Apparently NOT the same guy she left me for. Or maybe. I dont know, exactly. I don't press it. 
* No reconciliation, but she constantly invites me along to hang out with her and the kids ""just for fun"". I have no idea why this happens. 
* Just a MASSIVE change from our married life. Talking with her, things are totally calm, peaceful, fun, engaging, enjoyable, even. But no talk,ever, of getting back together.
I have no idea what to do. Things just seem....like a mirror world all the time. There's no consistency. The above timeline is SIX MONTHS. 

I don't....know what to do. Can anyone normalize this for me? Is this normal behavior or is this pretty far from normal behavior? If you ask me to present what I've done, I'll be more than happy to present my own mistakes and present my own faults as straightforwardly as I can.

I have been dealing with varying levels of depression and anxiety since I was about 8 (I'm 26 now) when an avalanche of family issues created a unbalance. I saw someone as a child, but stopped in the early teens when it seemed like I had the ability to handle my issues. I was able to cope for much of my adolescence and teenage years, then had a break down at 19 due to a bad relationship and years of repression. I saw someone for a time and was placed on anti-depressants. I did not enjoy these as I felt like a zombie constantly in an emotionless haze. At the age of 20 I stopped the medication and began self medicating with alcohol. By the age of 23 I was in a very dark place due to a living and working situation. I was able to crawl out of that hole and rebounded slightly by 25. 

At 26 I started law school. The stress made me very anxious, to the point of that it was impairing my ability to do well in school. Decided I could not return to the self medication route, I sought professional help. Last winter I was proscribed low dose Lexapro for anxiety and low dose Xanex for any panic attacks. For a time I did well, but recently have felt myself slip (I am away from my therapist at the moment). 

I have often been told that medicine and consoling should help return me to my ""old self"". My problem is that I do not remember a time when my ""old self"" was anything but a fluctuating imbalance. Perhaps it is cliche, but I cannot remember a time when I felt happy for more than a few days in a row. My question, or request, is if anyone here has advice as to how to tap into my ""old self"" I would greatly appreciate it. I have been struggling for sometime, and my will grows weaker with every set back.

The decision to go on Venlafaxine is merely a trial for right now. This year, my social anxiety has made it incredibly hard to be in certain environments and it was crippling me beyond that when depression is thrown into the mix. I have been on Mylan Bupropion for the past year and I recall the first week or so took some serious getting used to. I had difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, less of a diet, and less energy in general to do things. I'm feeling very similar symptoms alongside a sore/dry throat with Venlafaxine and from the information I've gathered, it might not settle in for another week.

I don't know what is going on. I thought everything was getting better, between therapy and getting on Zoloft, but I'm becoming more and more aware that things are not getting better. I'm still convinced my friends do not want me around and ressent my presence. I still think that every time my roommates are talking and I can't hear them, they're talking about me. But if I can hear them, then they are deliberately rubbing in my face that they don't want to talk to me and that I don't exist to them.

And I really want to talk to my therapist about this. But I don't think he'll believe me. I think he'll say I'm a liar. Or that I'm making this up for attention. Especially because I have a lot of upheaval in my life, and therapy usually ends up being just a random spill of whatever is making me most emotional at the time. I've wanted to bring this stuff up for abot a month now, but I get derailed. And. He might think I'm making things up for attention because I admitted I wanted to die last time and that I'd been thinking about how to kill myself. But I haven't called the crisis hotline or anything because I'm too afraid. And, honestly, as much as I want to die, I have no motivation to do anything about it.

I feel like I am slowly going crazy and this cannot rule my life. It has begun to creep into the daytime and has started to cloud my thoughts at work making it hard to focus.

I've been pressing the issue that he should get help for his suicidal thoughts, ""void"" feeling (in which he feels nothing), self-hatred, self-harm, hallucinations, etc. But I feel like there is something else wrong...possibly a depersonalization thing? 

The things he tells me makes me feel like he's not in touch with reality as well as a normal person would be. He takes a long time to realize things that are obvious—an abusive relationship—until it gets way too far. He says he's had instances where he's not sure if something really happened or it was just a thought or dream, and that one time he had an out of body experience. He also said that a lot of times he forgets he has a body. That strangest thing so far that he's told me is how at one point he heard three voices in his head that were of his consciousness, but not really at the same time? He said one always insulted him, one was him, and the other stood up for him from the insulting one. Now he's saying that he feels like those voices have developed personalities, and he sees himself as different people, but he knows it's all him at the same time. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I'm really concerned about him, and I haven't told him that these new things he tells me is really worrying and scaring me. Does it sound like he might have possible depersonalization or is this normal?

I won't go into my exact age or where I live but I will say I'm a teenager and live in the USA. Onto the story. My brother joined the navy around 8 years ago and slowly cut off contact with my whole family. He sent a letter addressed to my mom and dad(separated) TYPED saying he didn't want any more contact with them and iirc the letters he sent were identical. I had pretty much given up on getting my brother back until he added one of my aunt's daughters(cousin) on facebook. The cousin told my sister about my brother striking up contact with her, so naturally I added my brother and messaged him to see how he was. I was unaware of his condition at the time and only got one response from him, asking how each of our immediate family was doing by their first name which I wasn't sure was a good or bad sign. No response since then but he's been making facebook status posts that are very troubling. He's threatened people, saying straight up ""these people will die"" and listing names. A little research done on these names has led to former classmates that may have have tormented him as a child. In his facebook posts he has displayed visions of grandeur, posting a status in which he says he is homeless but has a secret that will make him rich. Also something related to a comedy career that is making him millions of dollars. He also posted that he is in Berlin, Germany, eating Mcdonald's and turning in cans for money. I couldn't bring myself to look at his posts again so I apologize for no screenshots, but the delusions and grandeur definitely appear to be there. In April he turned 26 which I've read is a prime time for males to develop schizophrenia. My sister has a friend who happens to be in Berlin and I believe my brother has had contact with him on facebook and trusts him. My brother seems to think the friend can help his delusional comedy career. The friend has also said he will help us in our mission however he can. How do I approach this? My mom just broke down and we both cried, I'm trying to keep her together until she gets her vacation time so we can process this and figure out what to do. I'm open to any ideas, especially from those who have schizophrenia or have treated it or been around it, or even anyone with any clue how I can help my brother get back to being himself. He's a really smart 26 year old man who has a mental illness and needs help. These are the main options we have so far.

Option 1: He had a visa to go to school in Germany, or so I've been told. I've also been told that it is now expired. Can we get him deported back to the USA? We obviously cannot help him from thousands of miles away. I don't know what the process would be, especially considering he is homeless and how this would affect his emotional state, maybe forcing another psychotic break? I'd imagine being arrested and deported would be very traumatic and force him deeper into delusions.

Option 2: He seems to be trusting of my sister's friend who is in Berlin. Could we set up a meeting between my brother and my sister's friend? This option involves all or some of my family going to Berlin on my mom's vacation. My brother doesn't seem to be willing to set up a meeting with us, his family, but trusts my sister's friend. So the friend could set up a meeting with my brother and then we come along too and try to talk him into coming home? Again, I don't know how this would affect him psychologically or if he would go along with it.

These are the only options I could possibly compile, and it's a really messed up situation, and crying with my mom is probably the most depressing experience I've had as a teenager. With regards to this thread, if nothing else I guess I was able to vent, but I'm gonna post this in as many subreddits as I need to in order to get a response. Once again, any ideas especially from mental health professionals or sufferers themselves would be amazing. Thank you reddit.

TL;DR- Brother is an undiagnosed schizophrenic demonstrating all of the symptoms through his facebook posts. He is homeless in Berlin and has made threats on facebook to former classmates. Two options include getting him deported because of his expired school/work visa or setting up a meeting between him and my sister's friend and being there as well which involves flying to Berlin. None of us want to damage him even further by ambushing him in Berlin but we also don't want him being a danger to himself or others on the streets so we're not sure what to do.

So my brother has been pretty stagnant for the last five years of his life. After finishing secondary school he went to college to study as an electrician. He subsequently failed and dropped out of this course after a year. He then proceeded to do plumbing the next year and again the same event occurred. Since that time he has spent another three years not creating anything, he has no drive or ambition. He has been on job seekers allowance but got kicked off for not complying with there rules when they found him a job. He now works as a pot-wash in some pub.
He shuts himself away constantly in his room whenever he's not working which is most of the time. Refuses to communicate with the family about the issue even though we try to approach it sensitively. I get the feeling he feels he's being criticized. We aren't criticizing him, no one shouts we just make him try to understand. If we take this sensitive approach he'll just tell us what we want to hear, 'he has plans' or 'he's working on something'. Whenever we ask him what these plans are he says he doesn't have to explain himself to us and walks off. So you can see how it's a no win situation for us. More to this he never eats with the family even though we ask him too, he'll get a takeaway late at night instead. His room smells foul, i can't understand why. I think it may be because he eats in there and stays there constantly without ever changing the sheets.
More to this my mum has caught him weeing in a cup and throwing it out of the window instead of going to the toilet which is located adjacent to his room. He has a TV in his room but it has a huge crack which makes viewing difficult. He has no laptop and usually takes my sisters kindle to browse the internet.
My question is this, how can I help him? As his brother I want him to do amazing, to not fear anything in life and follow his purpose. At the moment i fear his way of living will cause depression or illness. The worst thing is he used to be such an outgoing character five years ago before all this happened.

My grandmother on my dad's side was admitted to the ""Johnson Unit"" after having a mental breakdown and my aunt, again on my dad's side, is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. I don't hear voices or think ""they"" are controlling or reading my thoughts. I don't have special powers. I don't think I'm Jesus. I do think there is something wrong though.

I read through the Yale Prime test for schizophrenia and have answered some of the questions with answers that concern me:

I may have felt that there could possibly be something interrupting or controlling my thoughts, feelings, or actions. [Somewhat agree] For the past year or two it's been hard to focus, I don't think anything is controlling my actions, but my thought processes are sometimes being interrupted.

I think I might feel like my mind is “playing tricks” on me. [Somewhat agree] I see stuff out of the corner of my eye, like a shadowy blob sometimes. I also feel like someone is standing behind me at times. Also, looking at stationary objects, they sometimes ""shiver"" or get wavy.

I have been concerned that I might be “going crazy”. [Somewhat agree] I understand that this sort of thing ""runs in the family"" and that it develops in a persons early to mid 20's. I'm 27.

This might not have anything to do with it, but I took a melatonin capsule to help me sleep last week. I had terrible dreams and then the following day my emotions were unstable. For instance, out of nowhere I would feel extreme sadness to the point of tears welling up in my eyes.

I also have a hard time forming sentences and sometimes pick up a conversation with someone and they'll have to tell me to back up and ask what I'm taking about.

Should I see someone about this?

I started to become really paranoid, at one point, had been to my doctor to eventually get antidepressants and she referred me to the hospital for blood tests, when I was in the hospital I thought I could hear the nurses talking about me, I thought they were going to inject me with something, I was constantly on the verge of freaking out and running out of the hospital but managed to stay quite calm and get through it. 

I had some pretty delusional thoughts, and some hallucinations but think they were caused by antidepressants.  Other weird symptoms like listening to music at a friends house, I became really distracted by the words, and couldn't pay attention to my friends. Eventually they went away, but I was pretty depressed for months afterwards.

I've been worrying that it could happen again, and whether this means I was psychotic, or that I'm schizophrenic or something else. I was too scared to talk to a doctor about it, and I'm still scared to mention it. If I see a counsellor and bring this up, will they mention it to my doctor?

**Background/Information**

Hi guys. I'm 21[M] and recently had my baby boy 9 months ago. Because of my tendencies, (Sociopathic) I had no real relationship or connection with the mother, it was mainly my ""tests""/""experiments""/""curiosity"" that kept me going on with the relationship, which with the way I ""feel"" and think. When I say experiments and tests, it was really just small things that I would take as an opening to find out more and more about how things worked in her head.

I was physically abused as a child by a drunk, and starting off a way to put me in a nutshell, I've observed everything in my life that I could possibly learn from. I don't have idol's or people I look up to. I'm extremely ambitious, social, and learn from people's mistakes. I was the child my dad didn't want, and my brother was his favorite. I never had anything close to share with my brother, because he was pampered while I was neglected and used as a child support check. I could never confide in anyone in my family, so I became very reclusive in my own thoughts and emotions. I observed everything, absorbed everything, and adapted from it. That's my reasoning in a nutshell.

But that's not really what bothers me. I'm aware of my tendencies, and really as far as other peoples' morals go, I would be seen as immoral, and hard to trust. I only ""mess""/""manipulate"" people who fall into certain criteria. My ex is not in the criteria, but if anything I've ""done"" to her is to help her realize how manipulation works, (she has a sister who's a no-face who has some serious drug and psychological problems.)

Here-in lies my problems, where I would like some help/advice. As far as people with Sociopathic tendencies that I've talked with go, we all share a common trait. We don't ""Turn off"" our emotions, but we feel a few very strongly, (curiosity is the strongest, and anger is second) and other's we can be completely numb to; guilt is impossible for me to feel, and regret is very seldom. If I've ever regretted something, it's because I feel that my form/execution of whatever was the trigger was bad, or I did not prepare for the outcome of the situation.

---
**My Concerns**

My problem that I'm coming to you now occurs when I have to take care of our son. I love him to the end of the earth; he is the spitting image of me, and is absolutely adorable in every aspect. But, as I mentioned before, one of the two strongest emotions I feel is anger. My friend's wife, who also has tendencies, is the only person I've talked to about these issues. She's described it as a ""black rage"" that is extremely hard to control, and I usually only get when I lose my patience with someone who isn't rational, and those who are abusive.

At night with my son when I'm trying to get sleep for working the next day, I will get *extremely upset* when he doesn't do what I want, or what I expect. It's like I've set up this precise formula of how things are going to go, and he just does unpredictable things. I'm absolutely retarded for thinking that it's how my night should go, but I can't help but try and set up formula's for the **perfect** situation. 

---
**My feelings**

I will get aggressive, but I wouldn't harm him. I get very stern, and somewhat physical. I don't shake him or anything, I look him deep in the eyes, and hold him close and restrain him from moving. *that* is my ""black rage"" that I can't control. I'm so afraid I'm going to hurt him with how stern and angry I can get get. He will cry, and then I immediately cool down, and comfort and soothe him afterwards. This is the one time I will feel regret and guilt, and I will get extremely emotional like I've never done before. I know I'm not hurting him physically, because it's really just about restraining him from wiggling around without a ton of pressure, but there have been times where I might have been too harsh. **I'm scared I'm going to leave scarring impressions on him that he will never be able to trust me because I get angry.** I don't know what to do, and I'm extremely scared that I'm going to become my father and not be able to control my anger.

I don't know what to do from this point forward, which is why I'm here. Should I seek counseling? Does anyone have any recommendations for meditation when I lose my patience? I'm at a complete loss here.

I've had problems since I was little dealing with anger and being unable to socialise with others and spent most of my childhood in my own company. Since about the age of 8, I've struggled with the urge to pull my own hair out, to the point where I've had no eyebrows or eyelashes. However my mother felt to ashamed to admit there was anything wrong with me to get me any help, despite instructions from the doctor and school that it would be in my best interest.

Since highschool my depression has slowly gotten worse, and there have been times when I have been sleeping 18 hours a day, and despite my best efforts I ended up failing uni because due to exhaustion, apathy and inability to focus. I try and read and all I hear in my head is white noise.

The few personal relationships I've had have struggled due to my behaviour. I struggle with trust, I often find myself spending hours learning about people through using Google for accounts and past posts to the point where I'll find myself several hours later, full of shame that I would mistrust or invade peoples privacy this way. I feel as though I have to search out that these people are hiding things from me that would hurt me, even though they give me no reason to. I will find myself convinced that they are lying and there is evidence in what they've said, yet come back to the thought later and see how utterly irrational I have been. Obviously this causes huge problems in romantic relationships. 

I'm constantly afraid that someone might hear my thoughts and I will upset them, or that people I know have my webcam hacked or they can see my desktop and see that I'm not trusting them.

When I deal with people, unless it is a 'scripted' conversation, like with a customer, or with a close friend, I find it almost impossible to hold conversations. I try and think of what to say and my mind becomes blank, I also feel like I struggle with expressing emotions. I feel like I might offend someone by showing the wrong emotion or that they might view me weak if I show sadness. My counselor always noted that I never seemed to show sadness when describing sad or bad memories. I felt it was important to internalise, I would feel ashamed if I let on that I did feel sadness.

I've struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, even when not feeling depressed. I've never felt the urge to act, but I have such derp self loathing that I feel like it's my own way of scalding myself. I deserve that, and I bring upon the hate of everyone else deservedly.

I've been on a decline since my mid teens, and I feel like I'm just getting worse. I'll snap at family for small reasons and make them feel bad, then I will feel terrible because they don't deserve it. I'll freak out at the slightest thing, something as silly as misplacing a shoe will send me into a fit of rage and self hatred. 

Each time a wave of depression hits me I feel like it gets worse. I've tried to eat better and I sleep less now, my attention span has improved a little, but I feel like the smallest thing could send me back to the very depths.

I'm so afraid to bring any of this up with anyone, I fear they would institutionalise me. I think this post is more a vent, I'm sorry it probably doesn't make much sense.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I just need to vent, I have nowhere else I can say this."

I'm currently on a wave at the moment and feel like I just have to let it pass and not drown. Everybody has calming techniques and advice and tips but all I did last night was sit on my hands on the sofa for 2 hours and occasionally nip upstairs when I couldn't cope and check the mirror and cut my hair. Or when I couldn't find my scissors, put my leg razor to it. Then go back downstairs and sit on my hands so I'd stop it again. Sitting in the dark. Letting the feeling pass.

Today I feel better but very achy - my jaw, my back, my head. My hair is wrecked and I know that and feel a little sick to think that for a glorious week my hair seemed okay. 

My problem is I don't recognise when it's coming, it does really seem to come in waves. I'll perhaps start biting my nails more than usual, or feel very tired earlier in the evening, or have problems staying asleep. Then I'll have a week of torment that I just have to let pass where the only thing I can do is try to stop myself from being destructive to myself, from chopping all my hair off or scratching at my face (it seems oddly alluring at the moment).

People's advice never seems to fit me. Or perhaps it would work for me and I'm too currently self destructive to take it. Things like 'go for a walk' ... if I do, I find myself going into an anxiety attack. I feel incredibly tense at the moment at work, though I enjoyed the cycle here. I keep having to hide for a minute or two in the toilets, but there are mirrors there and they call to me unhelpfully. My friend and my sister yesterday were very good, just sat with me in quiet. That was helpful but I don't know why. Perhaps it made me feel guilty whenever I wanted to break away upstairs again.

In school my dad was the one who attended all my parent evenings.
He would attend to watch me play sports, he would always make sure he kissed me goodnight, he'd ask how my day was and he made it important that if we ever argued that by the next day it was over and forgotten and treated me like his son. 
My mother is the complete opposite of all the above. She never attended any of my parent evenings, she didn't give a shit that I was an athlete for my school and played other sports outside of school. She wasn't ever interested in my studies, just knew how to make me feel like shit if she suspected I was slacking or whatever she was thinking. I passed college 2 years after my father died and I didn't get even a well done from my mother. Like it was just expected or something. I'm at University now and I live at home still, I'm depressed, I've failed my second year of University but passed it second time, but I don't feel like I'm making any progression, I don't get any encouragement from my mother, all she does is watch TV and drink wine every night. She literally only knows how to tell me what to do. Or to tell me off for things I haven't done. Or to ignore me for days on end and make me feel like the shunned black sheep of the family. I fucking hate it. I don't hate her, I love my mother but I can't connect with her in any area of my life or hers. She doesn't talk to me about anything. Ever. She looks at me funny as if she's judging me whenever I come downstairs in the morning. I really can't take it anymore. She doesn't even act like she likes me as a person. It's fucking killing me. I'm writing this from my bedroom that I haven't left since I came in from work because I don't want to walk past her downstairs because there's this awkward silence I have to endure all the time as if she's mad or something. This is affecting me everywhere in my life. I talk to people with respect but they see me as weak and talk down to me thinking I'm going to be their subservient underling or something. I don't have any confidence to do anything, let alone study sometimes. I'm nothing compared to the person I was when my father was alive and I believe it's because he knew how to cultivate my spirit (as weird as that sounds), he was always friendly, nonjudgmental but strict as a good father, encouraged me whenever I needed it and so on, but my mum treats me like she doesn't give a shit for any of my emotional / mental needs and I'm constantly feeling guilty or worthless. Sometimes I really just want to off myself. I'm not even joking. 
The other day my mum came in from work and I had swept the house clean, hoovered, cleaned the dishes but decided to have a sandwich, so I used a plate and forgot to clean it and left it in the sink. My mum comes home and all hell breaks loose. Apparently me leaving a ""dirty"" (a few crumbs :|) plate in the sink is enough to warrant me being absolutely shamed for not cleaning it, telling me that she works long enough hours to not want to come home and find the sink free, but she's shouting this to me in a pissed off tone. I got so pissed off from having to endure so many of these bullshit outbursts of hers that I argued back telling her she's making a mountain out of a molehill, saying i""t's just a plate, you don't have to shout, just remind me it's there and I'll clean it immediately"" but she wouldn't take that and continued to be angry so I got angry cause her anger was just too much for me to take so I basically shouted and kicked a hole in the living room door. My first outburst ever. My mum will now not look at me or talk to me, and I am not apologising. It sounds stubborn or whatever but I deal with so many stresses that she gives to me that aren't even stress-worthy. I try to be objective but she's too emotional and I can't take it. I also don't ever deserve to have the silent treatment from her. I just don't fucking understand :(

I should say at the outset that we are trying to get her treatment but as its a holiday and we're not really sure what's going on, and mental health facilities are not good in our area we're still figuring out what to do.  I'm wondering if anyone here has advice or insight on the situation.

She seems to be having delusions, but they don't seem to fall neatly into the normal categories.  From my vantage point she seems to be operating from the playbook of a religious cult, except as far as I know she doesn't have any contact with anyone like that.  She says things like ""a new world is at hand"" and other things that seem to take on a vaguely religious tint.  Earlier today she stole merchandise from a store and explained it by saying ""in the new world everything is free"".  These statements don't seem to be self-important or grandiose in nature, just a bit spooky and quite ""off"" really.

She also appears to mumble to herself a lot, although it's not clear to me if she's responding to voices or just carrying on a conversation by herself.

Obviously she's having some kind of episode, stealing isn't normal behavior.  But we're not really sure where to go from here.  Obviously book an appointment somewhere, but we're not sure where.  We're also not sure if she will go--seems unlikely, based on what I've seen.

Ever since I was in middle school I have been fighting loneliness. It seemed like no matter what I did or who I did it with, I would always feel alone. This problem of mine is how I believe I fell into depression originally.Well, years and years later; I haven't been getting much better. I started hearing voices that weren't there in the past year and a half or so. I can barely sleep because of it, I turned to taking obscene amounts of sleeping aids or just drinking until I pass out. Even as I type this I have not slept in 48 hours and I still cannot seem get any rest. I turned to lighter opiates like codeine to help with the depression, although it feels as if I cannot run from depression for much longer.

Recently, one of my closest friends has been speaking to her therapist about me. This just isn't any friend, this is the -tell everything to- best kinda friend. So She has been giving very detailed descriptions (as far as I know) of my problems and recent ""episodes"" to her therapist.

With severe suggestion from my friend and her therapist I am attempting trying therapy for the first time. I know different practitioners will have differing methods but...

1. What should I expect?

2. Should I prepare something?

3. What is the ""patient/therapist"" etiquette?

I always treat everybody as good as I can though.

* I don't maintain relationships well of any sort. I don't keep in touch with most of my family. I have an especially difficult time opening up to women and being friends. Most of my friends are guys and they never last long. Romantic interests have a short life span. The longest romantic relationship I had lasted five years and I have not had anything last beyond a year since.

* I'm pretty sure I have some sort of anxiety and I am constantly bouncing between loving and hating myself. I have considered suicide before. At the end of the five year relationship, it was like I lived in a dark cloud for nearly a year.

* I feel like I make poor decisions because I expect the result will make me happier.

I have managed to keep depression mostly under control with physical activity. Although I am self aware of my issues, I don't know how severe they are or how to proceed. I think it would be a huge improvement to have a group of friends. A huge problem I am running into is putting too much pressure on romantic interests to provide companionship and happiness.

Over the year, we became really close friends, to the point where we consider each other one of the best friends we ever had.

After a while of knowing her, I found out that she had many problems with the people within our social circle. She used to be and still is, although a tiny bit less than before, very promiscuous which is a cause for most of those problems.

Through our friendship, as we got to know each other better, she told me some things about her that left me stunned. This was actually the moment where I realised that I should never judge people before I hear their story.
In fact, some of the things I am about to mention I only found out recently. 

She has had a very tough life. She has been the victim of rape twice, her father used to abuse her and beat her wen she was a child to the point where she would be near unconsciousness and be left with very visible bruises about which she had to lie about so people would not find out. She was verbally abused and judged by teachers and peers. 
At this point I realised that her behaviour and the mistakes linked to sex and commitment she continually continues to make might be a result of the things that happened to her in the past.

I noticed that she shows some behaviour that would be the one of a sociopath. Once we had a serious talk, and she admitted to me that she only uses most people. However she also mentioned that she does have genuine feelings for a small amount of people and that I'm one of them. 
She also said that she knows what she is doing is wrong and that she thinks she is a horrible person for doing it. A couple of times she called me when she had panic attacks, and I managed to calm her down.

While she does do some things that a sociopath would do such as using people for her advantage or being promiscuous, she doesn't do other sociopathic things at all, for example being violent or cruel.

This might be important: The same day she admitted it, she actually said that she genuinely feels bad about such behaviour and that she wishes one day she'll change it and could for example stay faithful in a relationship.

So considering that despite her sociopathic tendencies, could it be possible that she is not a full on sociopath and that she does have certain actually true emotions?

She tried to commit suicide earlier this year, in April. She overdosed on pills but then in the last moment told her mother, who called the ambulance.
When she was in hospital, she called me. She told me what happened and asked me not to tell anyone else. To this day, I remain the only person except her mother who knows she has attempted suicide. 
We also are interested in each other as more than friends. But once she told me that she wants to be with me, but doesn't want to right now as she doesn't think she would be able to remain faithful and she doesn't want to ruin what we have.
I was quite confused by this, but then I realised that it might be a good thing. Because if she just wanted to use me, she wouldn't tell me and probably just get in a relationship with me instead.

She told me once that she really did have true feelings for someone in her life but she can't see them as she was forced to move to a country we both live in right now and both hate.
I feel that over the time I became some sort of a safe house for her, as she mentioned to me a in a couple of weak moments that I'm the only person she can talk to and the only person she has.

To put it into perspective: Last time we were supposed to go out together, she told me she can't. When I asked her why, she said that she doesn't have any money and that she would feel bad if I paid for her again, as I did the previous time we were out. Now, wouldn't a complete sociopath just use me?

Although I care about her a lot, I'm trying to be careful.

So my final question is: Can someone with sociopathic tendencies still have some actual emotions? Or is it just either nothing or a full on sociopath?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Question about a disorder.

I am 31 yo Female. I have been experiencing a multitude of mental health problems for a large part of my life. My family is well respected and we lived in a very small town and i just felt like i could never bring these things up to a doctor for fear of what they would think and what my family would do if htey learned. I had not seen a doctor for probably 8 years but got a new family dr in february and had a physical done in march and mentioned to my doctor that i was feeling very depressed and stressed out but she just said ok and then we didn't discuss it further. So now, i really feel like i cant bring it up again. or if i can...how?

here are the symptoms im having:

-depression (no suicidal thoughts - but i have been feeling depressed for probably 3 years off and on)
-mental fog (i do accounts payable for work and have made many errors with math lately)
-my coworkers are always wispering in the next office and i think they are talking about me all the time
-i think about horrible things about my family members all the time (example: my sons phone died and i was trying to get a hold of him, all i could think for 3 hours was how he had been kidnapped and had horrible things happening to him. i mentioned this to my boyfriend and he said it is def not normal to think that, but i have always done this. my whole life. is that weird?)
-i cannot concentrate on anything

From a sweet little girl one minute to the biggest brat the next. I was well disciplined and a bright kid but my mood swings still continued. I guess I always thought they were normal because my mom did the same thing. 

Sometimes these mood swings got bad enough where if I was angry or extremely upset I would hurt myself, whether it was cutting, burning or just plain hitting my head with my hands or on a wall. I liked the pain not as a good feeling but a way to snap me out of it. I'd feel the pain and then I would realize how stupid I was acting. 

These mood swings subsided around junior high and early high school until I met my current boyfriend of 7 years. Things started out amazing! No mood swings. I guess that wasn't meant to last long as my mood swings came back, and in full force. I would go from sweet and love able to a sarcastic, selfish, self loathing bitch. I often say things I don't mean and most of the time these things are so hurtful it's hard for others to bounce back. And no one was immune, not even my perfect boyfriend. He was often caught in the crossfire of my mood, especially my anger. Now I'm never violent towards another person (aside from myself) so don't worry about the anger issue. The problem was that I was having so many problems it was making my boyfriend feel like he was walking on egg shells. He would say something funny or tease me in a cute way and I would turn it around and twist it to play the victim. I continued this until we had a major argument a few years back about how much I was hurting him. I started to think about what was happening and realized something must be wrong with me..

Here's what I feel, sometimes my mood can range from happy or even overly happy, to angry beyond belief and sometimes just way too sarcastic for my own good. I've noticed a few triggers, such as work stress, financial issues, alcohol and even video games. And I've tried to log my triggers and reward myself on my good days, but I'm not seeming any better.

But over the last two months I have realized that she probably does suffer from delusions. She is about 50 and lives by herself.
We first noticed she was a bit strange because she had strong political views against Angela Merkel (we live in Germany). 
I once asked her if she had any kids and she began a long speech explaining how it was Merkel's fault that her life was ruined, how she broke up Putin's and Hollande's marriage and how it would be much better if the Berlin wall was rebuilt and East and West Germany split again and the US droned Germany :S 

I thought to myself, it's okay, there are some radical views everywhere. 

She seems to be very paranoid, she thinks that the police and Merkel is out to get her. She was kicked out of her previous apartment for not paying she said her landlord also accused her of being an alcoholic (which I don't think she is.) 
She doesn't work because she was apparently fired from a hospital a while back, where was psychologist allegedly, and her driving licence was taken. And she now claims that Merkel, the landlord, the police in Bayern, the hospital and a Peruvian man who she says stalked her had planned to ruin her career. 
Yes, it begins to sound a bit far-fetched. 
She also claims that the police in Bayern told her she had to marry Prince Albert of Monaco, but she refused to because she said he was a 
rapist, and that was when the government began persecuting her. 

She gets no pension for some reason, and she says it is because Merkel is spending all her money.  

She suffers from asthma and other diseases and when a bee stung her, she called the hospital. After 40 minutes of waiting she rang my doorbell and told me they were all criminals and asked me to be with her when the doctor came because she was afraid of being alone with him. 

There are also tensions between her and a family of Kazakhs living in the building. She claims they are terrorists, drug addicts, alcoholic and dangerous. When one of her cats died (he was 17 years old!!!) she blamed them. 

In early May she began planning a BBQ party for everyone in the building to be held in July. She invited the mayor and the president of Germany and when told that because I was American I should invite Obama. She wanted the landlord and other neighbors to spend over 500 Euros in the party. 
Now that the landlord and another guy living in the building said that the party was cancelled, she says they are irresponsible and psychotic or are maybe on drugs. 

She needs help and has no one to take care of her. 
What should I do? She trusts and likes us but I fear that feeding her delusions won't help and opposing her might be just as bad. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Does my neighbor suffer from a mental illness?

sadthrowaway98,,,1404940395,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2a9w1o/are_these_symptoms_of_depressionanxiety_or/,2a9w1o,True,2,False,1441275651,3,"I'm a 25 year old male and was diagnosed with a depressive disorder at around age 10.  At around 18 I started developing severe anxiety, which has gotten increasingly worse since.  I've had bouts of suicidal urges, massive panic attacks that last a day or longer, chronic insomnia, lack of appetite, headaches and stomachaches, and general lack of energy &amp; downer mood.  All of this I understand; they're all symptoms of a disorder I've had for more than half my life and I understand how they work and how they exhibit themselves.

Because it's probably relevant:  For the past few months I've been taking increasing amounts of Welbutrin, currently 600mg daily, per the instruction of a psychiatrist who specializes in treating depression &amp; similar issues.  It's above the FDA approved dose but I haven't had any noticeable side effects, am being closely monitored by three different doctors, and the symptoms I'm about to describe started before this trial run, so I'm not if the Welbutrin is relevant or not.

8-9 months ago I had been taking 45mg of Mirtazapine daily, but it didn't really do the trick, and I went off of it when I became too depressed to go refill the prescription.... I went for about 5 weeks without meds before crashing hard and going back to the psychiatrist, and in the time I was unmedicated I started noticing these small brown-out/black-out episodes.  A bad panic attack can induce a similar effect to some degree, but not like this, and they don't seem to have any correlation to panic episodes.  Once I was driving down a road I've traveled 1000 times to my parent's house, and suddenly realized that nothing was familiar anymore.  When I looked at the GPS I realized that I'd taken a completely wrong turn for no apparent reason and driven close to 7 miles down some random road, through a few intersections, and another turn without realizing where I was going.  Another time I was sitting on the couch reading a book in the late afternoon, around 5 or so, and suddenly realized that I was sitting there with the book closed in my lap &amp; it was 7 o'clock and dusky outside, and I had no earthly idea how long I'd been sitting there or what I was thinking/doing in that time.

I've also been hearing things.  Small things, but they seem to be there.  I've had a recurring thing where suddenly I'll hear my alarm clock going off near my head, accompanied by a few seconds of complete derealization and a feeling like I'm waking up from a dream with the same wave of anxiety/fear/sadness that comes every time I wake up, and then it passes and I realize that I'm sitting at my desk at work and it was all in my head.  It makes me very anxious when it happens, to the point of actual panic attacks, but it has always seemed like the panic attack is a byproduct of the alarm and not the other way around.

Several times when this has happened, I then have a few minutes of weird thoughts, things like ""am I in a coma? am I just asleep? did I die? is all of this real?"", and while I'm able to reason my way out of it pretty quickly, it seems like an irrationally real possibility when I'm thinking that way.  I hope that makes sense.

I've also heard my dad's voice, once, very clearly calling my name from the other room... But he lives an hour away and there was no one else in my house at the time.  It scared the shit out of me and I immediately had a large scale panic attack which lasted into the next day.

My therapist keeps reassuring me, ""you're not going crazy and these are symptoms of extreme anxiety""

But for the past week I've been feeling bugs crawling on me that aren't there, and I'm becoming extraordinarily anxious about it.  I can't tell you how many times I've felt something crawling across my foot, frantically ripped my shoe off to check, and realized that there's absolutely nothing there.  It's happened all over my body, but especially with my feet/legs.  I don't think it's environmental, like I feel a loose thread in my sock and think it's a bug - it's happened clothed, completely naked, while showering, while driving with my arm right in front of my face and there's clearly nothing there.  It happens a lot as I'm trying to sleep.  I'll be lying there and feel something scuttling up my leg or arm, throw the covers off, and there's nothing.

I see my therapist again tomorrow and will of course be discussing this with him, but I just wanted to get outside opinions on the matter.... Am I schizophrenic?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Are these symptoms of depression/anxiety, or something else?"

When I was 22, who knows why but I started becoming a pretty bad hypochondriac and germaphobe.  This was unusual for me because growing up I was not worrisome in even the slightest, especially in regards to my health.  I'm at the point now where I am dreadfully afraid of cancer, afraid of dying (specifically from cancer), and this fear is controlling and ruining my life.  Not a day goes by I'm not panicking that weird body pains or symptoms I experience are in fact cancer.

Now, about 2 years ago I went through a major depression and began developing a whole mess of health problems shortly thereafter.  First was anxiety and panic attacks, then food allergies, then tons of chronic stomach pain and acid reflux, chronic fatigue, headaches, and a whole slew of random and strange symptoms.  Since then, I have been going to doctors non stop, (usually one per month at least), have gotten quite a lot of pricey diagnostic tests (paid out of my pocket, and more on the way), and even have scheduled visits with doctors for second opinions.  So far nothing serious has shown up other than lactose intolerance and stomach bacterial overgrowth, and doctors just keep saying I ""Probably"" have IBS and also that the majority of my symptoms are a direct result of depression and anxiety.  Most doctor visits have ended with them trying to pass anti-depressants off on me.  

Despite all these visits where doctors have yet to felt alarmed, I for the life of me can not stop worrying that I have cancer....  I feel that until I have every test in the book I'll be fearful I have cancer, and even after a complete all clear, will probably begin worrying again in 3 months that I got cancer in that short time.... It is ruining my life.  

I think a lot of my fear has stemmed from the internet.  Seems every time you Google a medical symptom it immediately suggests you have cancer.  A day doesn't go by where I don't see on media or social sites heartbreaking stories about people dying from cancer, sometimes not even knowing they had cancer.  TV has stories of cancer, the news has cancer, cancer stories seem to be everywhere, and lots of times many of the victims seem to be quite young (even 20s and 30s in some of these stories I read!).  I wonder to myself, ""How could these people not know before it's too late?"", but that's apparently the scariness of the disease.  All these reasons are why I have been so obsessively hyper vigilant about worrying that I might have cancer myself, even if I do seem healthy to doctors.  

What can I do to stop worrying, worrying so much that it's ruining my life. Is there anyway I can ever feel confident I don't have cancer and begin moving on with being happy in life again?  Help!  Any advice is appreciated!


EDIT: Title should read ""fear is ruining my life"".

She has a GP, cardiologist, neurologist, and  some other doc but none seem to be treating her depression.  She is losing weight, has very little appetite and mopes around all day until bedtime then sleeps over 10 hours.  She used to be a wired insomniac.

My dad has tried asking her to see a therapist and I have as well but she just grumbles about how they can't help her.  She has seen a few in the past but then soon stops showing up for appointments.  I have a few clues where her depression came from but I'm certainly not a licensed professional.

The notes talk about how everyone is mean to her and we treat her wrong, she is ""ready to just die"", and she feels utterly stupid and useless.  It was recently confirmed that a brain injury incurred as a teenager is wrecking havoc now, but unless I'm misreading things, she is MORE depressed and doing less about it now, instead of feeling relieved to have a diagnosis and action plan.  Either way she is very angry at how ""badly"" we treat her, how nobody comes to visit (which is odd because she always complains when people DO visit), and tells us over and over and over that she is too depressed to do anything - but refuses to let us take her anywhere or find her a therapist.  I don't know what she expects us to do...

She's also a hoarder.  Due to climate damage, washing machine flooding a room, and home repairs and renovations my dad and I are having to remove a lot of her stuff.  He had asked her to please please please  start getting rid of at least the stuff that was flooded and now moldy but she just won't.  Its been a few months since the flood.  She sits in her chair and watches TV and yells at squirrels on her bird feeders all day.  I happen to be unemployed, so my dad ""hired"" me to come de-clutter, design and build storage for the rooms, and help with painting and decorating once the renovations are completed.  Mom seems excited at the thought of getting a sewing room and having all her ""treasures"" cataloged into clear bins.  On the other hand, she's so morose and listless the rest of the time that I'm really not sure what is going on.  Numerous people in r/hoarders have told me this ""forceful de-cluttering"" is hurting her feelings but there is black mold, mouse issues, silverfish, scorpions out the wazoo, and who knows what else.  She has been warned for years (possibly over 30) that if she doesn't do it herself, someone else will.

I am a 30 years old multicultural Eastern European male, and I am afraid (not anxiety in the ordinary sense) of most White women, especially and particularly of fit and attractive ones. I am alone now and I have not had any intimacy, since I separated with my first and only girlfriend and partner of many years, 5 years ago due to my work, she was South-East Asian. My colleagues and more or less random strangers off the internet evaluate me as being fit and moderately attractive. In terms of body size I am 5'11(181cm) and 150 pounds (68 kg).

I feel that the following section is somehow relevant for the understanding of my situation - I am not religious nor I have ever been religious, nor I have grown in an overtly religious family. In sexual terms - I would probably identify myself as pro-prostitution, pro-sex feminist or ally. I have consensually tried many different things and fetishes with my ex-girlfriend. I think that pornography has very probably no influence on sexual behavior, and I think that any kind of fictitious pornography should be legal, because it's impossible to forbid thinking about something. 
I am neither for, nor against the animal rights, and I think that vegetarians or vegans are being unrealistic about physiology. I am for research on animals, against special conditions or support for farming, for the use of industrial farming, against bestiality laws but for the laws concerning unusual violence to animals, as it helps profile for potential violent offenders and killers, therefore making society safer in general.

I think that the earth is overpopulated and overburdened, but that the best and moral solution for the biosphere would be reduce reuse and recycle, and for the omnivores - to consume vat-grown human meat, and reproduce less, which is unfortunately impractical with today technologies and would be seen as damning, blasphemous or distasteful. I also feel that dictatorships are unworthy of existence and non qualifiable as human and that all who consciously voted for or helped a dictator made a quantifiable monetary choice, exchanging fundamental rights for money, and are as much liable for a dictator's actions and should be treated accordingly. I feel that punishment for the economical crimes should always be capital, if an embezzled or otherwise lost value is greater than the average economical value of a human life in OECD (2 million euro) and should always entail capital punishment for the whole family and reappropriation of property for the relief effort if the lost value exceeds 4 million EUR.

Now down to the problem.

When I see someone attractive on the street I usually cross the street. When I'm swimming at the pool and there's a woman I usually change lanes to be as far from her as possible (like I did today), when someone attractive speaks to me I usually maintain my composture and try and act as if nothing is wrong, especially in a professional situation, but in a more informal setting I make all the efforts to avoid anything that might lead to intimacy or friendship (usually by telling sob stories or something terrible about myself), but I am suffering. 

When I'm browsing the internet in private any porn or erotica with White women brings me to tears and in rare occasions makes me contemplating suicide - depending on my general mental focus. In fact this is one reason behind my post - I was just browsing imgur and I saw a picture of Emily Bloom on the user submitted feed, which resulted in me breaking a cold sweat and being on the verge of tears - I had to bite my arm to avoid it.

I am afraid of this and I cannot understand why it keeps happening or rather, I cannot believe that it could be happening for the following reasons. 

When I was around 5 years old I was raped by a couple of teenagers - a boy and a girl. I have had talks with my therapist and I don't think that it's relevant any longer.
In the middle school I was bullied (electrical torture, cutting, mob beatings) at school for my ideas and because I was somehow different for living in many countries, but I refused to respond, as I was forbidden by my parents to be violent toward anyone. After the beatings subsided, I tried to do some exercise and train, during that time (14-18 years old) I was taking metabolic steroids and melatonin synthesis modifiers on the advice of my late father, who was a researcher and a military specialist with a literal license to kill. 

Unfortunatly around age 21 or so I found out that I have a congenital heart disorder, which is under control now but which prevents me from doing any high-intensity sports and it's of course absolutely forbidden to take any metabolic drugs to increase muscle mass or anything which can mess with my sleep patterns.

I continued to train and do some martial arts for some time as I was still afraid of random people, that until 3 people attacked me in the park as I was out walking and enjoying the stars. I like stars, there is some longing nature to them, the feeling of universe. 
I don't remember much, but I remember breaking a leg of one of them and dislocating several arms, I also remember the moment when I had a realisation that I could kill them if I so desired, and that when let them go and stopped being afraid of any random males or walking alone in the dark anywhere.

However, when I look at my professional and NGO life, I feel that I have not accomplished much, since I have not finished my PhD in applied material sciences and my work contracts are quite impermanent in nature. Despite having worked in senior management positions, in my opinion, I failed to achieve my goals and certain of my interventions resulted in reduced international safety and worsened long-term safety prospects(also IMO - I don't have proof, but it's a strong hunch). I don't have a permanent living location, I don't have any money to my name, I don't consider myself to be in top physical condition and I think that most of my efforts to make this world any better have failed. 

I don't know what to do really - I've successfully been into therapy for anxiety, word block and boudary-setting with relatives, but my efforts to alleviate this problem, including an experiment with a female therapist, were unsuccesful. If one or several of you could make sense not only of my word salad, but of the underlying problem, I'd be very grateful. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Fear of women, feelings of worthlessness"

I have a new friend. We'll call him K (23M). I was talking to K on a hike and we landed on the topic of mental health and I decided to come out to him about having a mental illness. 

**(TRIGGER WARNING. I know not everyone likes the word ""crazy"", but I do. I think it adds a level of humor and helps me deal. If this language offends you, please skip down to TL;DR)**

Here's the gist of our conversation:

&gt;Me: I was almost committed twice. 

&gt;Him: Committed? 

&gt;Me: To a mental hospital? I'm crazy as shit, K. 

&gt;Him: You're not crazy. No one is crazy. 

&gt;Me: Mental illness is a real thing. 

&gt;Him: But yeah, who says mental illness is a thing? 

&gt;Me: I have a mental illness. I deal with this everyday. 

&gt;Him: You seem fine to me. I think you're fine. 

And then he cheesed all hard like saying I wasn't crazy was the greatest gift he could give me. The way he talked about it pissed me off. Things he said after (maybe he was just talking out of his ass to calm me down) that he does wanna talk about my run-ins with the law re: wellness checks and whatnot. But I want to go into that conversation letting his know that it's not okay to erase my illness just because it's invisible/I'm doing well after years of careful recovery? 

**TL;DR** *New friend doesn't really ""believe"" in mental illness and instead of having a productive conversation about over-diagnoses or anything like that he just erases my illness and all I wanna do is talk about it.

fast forward to 2008.  the occasional depressive episode starts to creep in.  it's rare and not the end of the world, so i accept it as a 'thing' leftover from before and move on with my life.

2011 .. my mental health starts going downhill.  i deal with it, because i can.

2012 .. it's getting worse.

2013 .. it's unbearable.  i realise that although i can handle it and keep on with my life, i don't have to.  i can get help.  i get help.  i try a few different medications and treatment regimes.  i start to accept that i probably have cyclothymia, which is basically bipolar lite, with some anxiety on the side.  i get some valium into me to relieve the anxiety and can identify both depressive and manic episodes.  various things interrupt these treatments and many things go wrong in the strictly chemical treatment of these conditions.  after digging into my family history i realise the family i thought were alcoholics were probably all dealing with this but self-medicating with booze.

2014 .. major relationship ends.  new one starts.  new girlfriend is .. actually amazing.  but i realise i have developed a habit of switching all my emotions off when they get too much.  i realise this is all related to the risk-reduction of my coping strategies, and try to disband them in an effort to better get to the root cause of my problems and try to understand what im experiencing.

this is not a pleasant decision.  thus began possibly the worst four days of my life.  worse than my fiancee leaving.  worse than my best friend dying.  everything i'd been putting into bypass for years, all coming out at once.  four days of absolute extreme mental torture.  by day 2 i was losing my mind.  by day 3 i'd lost the motivation to feed myself or go to work.  at this stage i'd have rathered be on fire than continue existing, and i don't know if any of you have been on fire but it is unpleasant.  by the end of day 4 i was sleeping at 8pm and crawled to bed from the couch.

it's the end of day 5.  i woke up this morning and it had broken.  i saw my psychiatrist this morning and got a new medication regime, and got a new psychologist who actually seems to know what the fuck he's doing.  i can see some hope for the first time in .. i don't know.  a long time.  i realise now i'd kind of resigned myself to having to push through it and be stronger than it but i realise that was flawed from the beginning.

i don't know what i hoped to achieve by posting this here but despite having good, loving friends who i can talk to, who helped me through this, i feel as if there's something about writing this on an internet place that is necessary and cathartic.

A little about myself... I am 31 years old, I was diagnosed with depression in 2006, and then with bipolar disorder in I think 2011 when I had a pretty bad manic episode. I have been fairly stable since then, mostly trying to cope with depression and occasionally suicidal ideation.

I am starting to plan out a documentary on mental health. I want to share my story with mental health and my volunteering with the Canadian Mental Health Association, as well as talking to others about their experiences. Also want to speak to professionals in the field.

What I am wondering is how can I narrow down the focus enough so that I can go in to some depth with a certain topic, rather than trying to cover a huge amount and not being able to go into any detail because there's so much to cover. Should I focus on depression, bipolar disorder, or just focus on a few people with a variety of mental health issues to mix it up a bit? Perhaps focus on stigma surrounding mental health, as this is something I feel is very important and is something I strongly believe needs to be reduced for people to get the help they need.

I want to create this because I am passionate about mental health. My goal is to create something maybe 30-45 minutes and release it on Youtube or Vimeo. I don't have aspirations of showing it in film festivals or anything but I would like it to be of a high quality and something interesting for people to watch. I plan to create a Kickstarter with a goal of raising a little bit of money for equipment rentals etc.

Hopefully this is a suitable subreddit for this post.

Mr. Roberts then demanded to see Mary in his office where the teacher told her that he wouldn’t tell Mary’s parents what she was caught doing if Mary performed sexual acts on him. On four different occasions, Mr. Roberts requested sexual favors from Mary, each time reminding Mary that if she told anyone, he would tell her parents that she was caught with another girl.

Mary begs Jennifer not to tell anyone of these events because her parents are very anti-gay and have made it clear to all their children that they would no longer be considered a part of the family if any of them chose to be homosexual.

Anyways I stopped and reversed all of my bad feelings and habits and was doing fine until recently.
A week ago, I was dreaming and the images just came back as vivid and painful as before and I'm really not sure how to clear them from my head.

I grew up in a violent household, was bullied at school, basically had an unstable childhood where neither home nor school was a safe place for me. I was diagnosed at 19 with depression (and am still struggling with it ten years later) though looking back something was 'wrong' with me from as early as twelve or thirteen.

So I went on medication for depression but it never really helped. I've always been tired, I overeat, am really bored, unmotivated, can't finish anything I start, or I have several things on the go at once, I don't focus well at work and I don't seem to learn well, I feel unhappy about life, my self-esteem is low, I procrastinate... I don't really do that much with my life other than work and rest (because I am so exhausted from my work week that I use the rest of my time chilling out or sleeping or blobbing). I've tried a few different meds and they either don't do anything or poop-out really early (fluoxetine) or give me horrible side affects (venlafaxine, citalopram, mirtazapine) so that I couldn't bear to stay on them long-term. 

I've tried natural stuff like increasing exercise, St John's Wort, trying to do more things I ""enjoy"" (except I can't really find things that I enjoy doing anymore), sleeping more, eating better. None of these things have changed my depression. I still frequently want to die, am constantly tired and really struggling with working and socialising because my mind wanders after 10 seconds of doing anything. 

So I was venting to someone and they suggested that perhaps I talk to a doctor about adult ADD because some of my symptoms seemed to line up with it. So I started reading. I have a LOT of the symptoms of the inattentive type of ADD and I also read that many people are often wrongly diagnosed with depression when actually they have ADD and depression can be a symptom of it. I thought perhaps this is something I should raise with a doctor. Then I also read that ADD is not something that can develop as an adult, it is generally present as a child (though overlooked). So I decided to dig out my old school reports and do some investigating.

I only have three reports from my schooling from before age 12 and they are all really positive! Apparently I was a hard worker, really focused, did well at public speaking, asked lots of questions, had fairly good self-confidence, worked well on my own, understood new concepts easily, completed all my work to a high quality and was known as a creative.

However, in my reports from around twelve and into my teen years, I started to get feedback like ""distracted, needs more focus, should have less chatter and more work, has potential but needs to apply herself, did not complete assignments, has lost interest in (insert activity here), struggling to understand some concepts"" etc. 

In honesty, I was shattered when I saw how positive my pre-teen school reports were. I was so sure that if those reports showed some sign of childhood ADD, then I'd have some hope of getting an accurate diagnosis and getting treated and actually having a happy, productive life. But if it seems I was doing really well before my teens, then I can't have ADD right? And if that's the case, what in the world went wrong in my life that I am such a failure now? I was so brightly creative back then and now I am only a shadow of that little girl. I am ashamed of the person I am now. If I really do just have depression then why does nothing work to make it better? 

Furthermore, what do I do from here?

Okay so at a young age I was attacked, without going into details,it led to being hyper vigilant, socially paranoid (may have cause my social awkwardness) and explosive reactions to certain situations (always the first to jump to defend someone who is being attacked). Also I've always had nightmares (usually a vivid cross between surreal horror (strange unimaginable monsters) with hyper-realistic details (like lucid dreaming I guess?)) 

I also had a very unfortunate situation happen where my trust in a friend was completely shattered by them taking advantage, and then lying about what happened afterwards.

And last I did sometimes have the occasional night terror when I was younger. The most extreme one (when I was younger) was due to codeine so I don't usually refer to it, but it may have something to do with this.

My question is namely this, at the age if 18 I started to have more night terrors, (more in terms of frequency) and also worse than what I had before. And then this frequency and worseness(?) furthered when I was 21. And these things frequently end up with me waking up while running through my house, screaming, or trying to fight things that aren't there. I would say I have a night terror on average 1 in every 2 weeks (that's a guess at an average I don't usually keep a record of these things)

Now I have successfully dealt with my other mental health issues (to the point that they still exist but almost as non-issues because I have a treatment plan that works) so I have no idea what's causing these. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Maybe able to point me towards a possible explanation?

I have always been a sensitive person and good with people. In elementary school i were friends with everyone. I was never really bullied in elementary school, mainly because how tall i was and how i never crossed paths with enyone. If someone tried to make fun of me, i would just laugh it off. I was a kind of a ""gentle giant"". This continued till nearly the end of high school.

Few guys in my class started making fun of me. I just laughed it off like i had always done, without thinking it more or less. This continued for a few days and then something struck me. I kind of woke up to the situation and realized that for the first time of my life, i was getting bullied. That i was the one being targeted. Sounds stupid, right? This had never occured to me before so i had no idea how to react. Being a sensitive person didnt help the situation.

I stopped responding to the bullies and tried to bear with it. I was never harmed physically, only verbally. The bullying never stopped and became worse for me everyday. The bullying continued to the end of highschool. When i was bullied i lost most of my motivation to school, got anxious of social situations and got a bunch of physical symptoms such as shaking and panic attacks. Then the summer vacation started.

The symptoms never stopped. I went to a psychiatrist and that helped me for a while. Im still afraid of social situations and i constantly try to guess what other people think about me. I can talk to people older than me and act normally, but not with people in the same age group as me or younger enymore. I have also lost motivation to do things i liked to do before.

So, about a year and a half ago this started. I'm constantly daydreaming and acting out what I'm doing in my head. As a result of this, I have trouble concentrating. For example, I'd get in the shower and inbetween snapping out of it and washing up, I just stand there stuck in my own head, laughing and smiling to myself while making up situations of me doing something funny or whatever...while also repeating the same movements I'm thinking about doing in my head over and over again. 

Another example: I'm washing the dishes. I start thinking about something random and I just stand there, not doing anything. Just smiling to myself.

Also, sometimes I think up situations in my head where I'm either sad or angry. These made up situations can either make me cry or just straight up make me mad in real life. 

I'm also incredibly socially awkward/inept. Maybe just incredibly shy, but I still have zero social skills of any kind. I've always been like that, but the whole uncontrollable imagination thing is fairly new. Well, the imagination part isn't, but the whole inability to concentrate or focus, acting out actions I'm doing in my head, laughing and crying in response to imagined scenarios in my head is fairly new. I should also add that I'm completely in control of what I imagine. 

And I know what you're thinking right now but I highly doubt I'm schizophrenic. I don't hear voices, but I do talk and say the things I'm saying in my head. 

I should also add that as a result of my social awkwardness and shyness, and mild stutter, that I've had more than my share of negative experiences throughout my middle and high school years.

What I have is a combination of traits/symptoms that have annoyed, baffled and on occasion scared away mental health specialists. I was wondering if you, reddit, could shed some light on this, and maybe see what they could not.

To start, I've been diagnosed with autism (with differing names and severities on several occasions, but the most-repeated appears to be aspergers and I sometimes feel this is because nobody can name any other type). I have trouble connecting to people and reading body-language. Noises, especially constant noise, like a radio or a highway, can give me a panic attack where I'm closer to crying than anything. I love language and maths, which appears relevant.

However. 
I'm also very good in talking to people. Where I misunderstand gestures, I understand meaning. I see patterns in words, and have perfected some of my patterns to the proverbial tee. I host garden-parties, which are always a blast, soirées that can last all night (also often outside because my house can't hold the amount of people that show up), and I'm always comfortable then. There's music, talking, noise, the occasional plate shattering and the rustling of the bonfire later at night and it NEVER gets to me. Sure, there's the rush of making sure everyone is seated, fed and hydrated, but the noise is just gone. No stress.

However.
People confuse me, sometimes, and they anger me. As they do everyone. And I have a supremely vicious streak that can take a lot of effort to suppress, on a daily basis, though I'm proud to say I've never hurt anyone or any creature, even in a of of rage, except for the rare case of self-defence. But the inclination, the drive, to hurt people to see how far I could take it, to see just how much pain one could inflict, is there and it's very real.
Hence the one time diagnosis of sociopath and the refusal of that particular psychologist to stop seeing me.

However.
I'm also someone who gets swept up in emotions and sensations as well. Some tastes are so strong they physically hurt. Some ideas, places, ruins or paintings so beautiful they make me cry. 

Then there's a few ADD and ADHD diagnoses, mainly because of a lack of focus or a tendency to hyperfocus, and an IQ of somewhere over 140 (because these things are inaccurate at best) and the fact that most of my friends think I'm normal, if a little bit quaint.

Perhaps I'm normal and everyone can relate to this. Maybe I'm just overreacting and none of this is even important/relevant. But I wanted to know what reddit thinks.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I have no idea what (or who) I am

On Anti-Ds atm, seeking professional help but unsuccessful as of late due to my nature. So here it goes in no particular order.

- Never really certain of anything
- Heavy memory-loss (I can remember events/things I did alone, some residual memory of emotions related to events but I can never really recall the event. I cannot recall faces, conversations, life events, etc)
- I have deep interconnected fantasies that can last hours each day. 
- The memories I do retain, the further they are, the less I can distinguish if they actually happened.
- Occasionally, my fantasy realities will blend or overlap with my primary reality. 
- Deep obsession with my own death.
- Occasionally hear banging sounds with my headset on
- Difficulty concentrating. 
- Anxiety in essentially all outside situations with varying degrees of intensity (I have absurd thoughts of being judged/getting hurt)
- I fucking always think people are staring at me
- I feel as though my inner voice is not actually mine but we get along nicely
- Can't read due to forgetting anything I've read the second after.
- Complete and total apathy. (Previously despair as well but anti-Ds pushes a few negatives those back atm)
- Zero interest in essentially life and general activities (Other than cleaning, oddly).
- No sense of self or identity. 
- I lack all essential emotions that make someone human (Joy, excitement, happiness, sadness, regret, love, etc) 
- Easily agitated when my concentration (Usually on my fantasy's) is broken. 
- Obviously very much a loner (I have a spouse and make good money)
- Everything seems scripted/surreal. Like a waking dream. I snap out of it sometimes and become aware, but I quickly reside without even noticing (Hard to explain).
- My mind is essentially like the white water rapids of thought and nothing really connects when put down on paper but it makes sense to me.
- Feel free to ask any questions

If you are wondering, I am completely functional due to a few methods/practices and some heavy focusing that allow me to get by and hold a job. 

I am not looking for any exact diagnoses just some general educated guesses from anybody with similar experiences or professionals. Researching, I appear to fit many criteria for several disorders but they never really feel like they are correct. Don't say seek professional help. I am. It is a pointless comment. The process takes a while and its hard to get a diagnosis without having psychotics shoved down your throat.

My brother was born with Spina Bifida. In many ways, he's felt like he's been unable to keep up in life with other people. Physically and mentally in some ways. At the same time, I've seen him at highs and lows. I know he can handle it, but self-confidence is a big issue.

Around middle school, he had some bad influences in his life. One of them encouraged him to lie about everything. In this way, he began to lie about almost everything. When he hit high school he started to stop focusing on school. He began caring 100% about the social aspects of school and stopped doing work. The teachers gave up on him after a while and my parents did as well. Needless to say, he didn't finish high school because of that.

In talking with him (he doesn't lie to me as often as other people), he tells me that he wants to finish his GED. He's afraid of failing at the test though. Because of this, he doesn't take it. And like a runner on a couch to 5k, the first hardest part is getting started.

Socially he doesn't get out much and just stays at home with my parents. My parents feel that he needs hand operating devices to drive a car. I don't agree with that; however, I do believe that he needs to build up strength in his legs if he wants to drive. Just like the GED though, he won't start doing that due to lack of self motivation.

Where we're at today, it's getting rough. He currently doesn't get out much at all. Basically his entire day is spent on facebook meeting random ""friends"" across the internet. He lies constantly to try and make friends. When that doesn't work, he acts vulgar to give off the impression that he's tough. I talk with him about that and he's not proud, but he admits that it's to try and win friends. He still believes that people will judge him for his condition and not accept him if he's honest. So, he lies to create an image that he wants to be (or thinks people want him to be).

He is about to be kicked out of my parent's house because he's 21 and not doing anything. The parents think that he needs the push to realize that he can't make it on his own the way he's living life. I agree although I want to see him leave on his own terms. But, he lies to them and me, so a reality check might help I think.

As far as counseling, he's been seeing a counselor but he just lies all the time during the meeting. I'm concerned that his consistent lying is not helping him get through his issues. What's worse is that he lives in a small town in the south and I'm not sure that he could even find a good counselor in town. Additionally, due to the spina bifida, there are health concerns. Basically, he needs to do a few more tasks on a daily basis in order to stay healthy which he does not do on his own. He lies about having done those things and often ends up physically sick due to the lack of taking care of himself.

What help I'm looking for is just some idea of how to help him or how to get him into the right program. He just needs the internal spark/drive for success. I've tried calling him regularly, but he stops progressing after one or two weeks. I'm thinking maybe a new counselor (one with experience dealing with very thick lying behavior) might help. At the end of the day, I just want to see my brother living the life he wants to live and to have the freedom that he wants. Any advice, help, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. In some ways I'm wondering if I'm all out of ideas for how to help him, but I know I'm not going to give up on getting him to where he wants to see himself.

But this summer something happened. I downloaded an old game that I used to play for hours when I was about 14-15 years old (now I'm 18), it's called Metin2 and it's a MMORPG. I downloaded it and deleted it a few times and after many times of day-dreaming about what I'd achieve in that game if I'd use real money, it just got me to the point of playing it the whole day and even skip meals and sleep. This wasn't a problem, as I said, about some months ago.

My girlfriend is in bad shape right now with depression and I'm not sure what else. She hasn't completely revealed what her mental illnesses are to me, but I have a feeling they're more severe than she's told me. I've dealt with some mild depression and anxiety in the past, but nowhere near what she's dealing with. 

Anyway, she recently (a few months ago) was able to move out of a homeless shelter. She had been there for almost a year after her last mental episode that resulted in a stay at a local mental hospital and then homelessness (she was just an acquaintance at the time to me). She's had the VA (she's a vet) and some case workers help her so far,  but there's only so much they'll do for her. She's living in a long-stay hotel room right now. She's been able to get enough income for living expenses through the GI Bill by taking college classes at the local community college. She also had been going to vocational rehab that gave her work to do. 

But now things have started to slip.... She hasn't been able to keep up with her school work the past couple weeks, and her grades are dropping. She has to keep her grades up to keep her financial support. She also had some trouble at work and she hasn't been there in 3 weeks.... She's started sleeping all day and only plays video games when she's awake. She needs to focus on school work or she'll lose her scholarships and grants and will become homeless again. Her room has become messy when she's normally a neat freak. 

I'm going to start helping her with her school work, and I'll try to see if she will go see the doctor about her meds and see if they need adjusting. 

This is something I'm not used to. I have no idea what to do or how to help. I'm clueless as to help motivate her enough to reach out for the help she needs. I'm only her girlfriend and that excludes me from helping her with medical stuff much. She has no family at all to help her, and I'm one of her very few friends.

I've been doing it without my parents knowing. She is very kind, and I feel really comfortable with her, but she does so many things that I know are just wrong/unprofessional but I've been settling. Part of it is because I am terrible with confronting people when they do something that upsets me. Another part is I'm scared to have to look for another therapist. 

I guess I should probably mention what she does. She reschedules ALOT. I shrugged it off each time because this I believe isn't her fault. She broke her back last year and still has problems. Its not her fault, but its pretty shitty to wake up to a text saying that you can't go to the one thing that helps you feel better. Especially because sometimes it happens multiple days in a row. (We have to reschedule to tomorrow, tomorrow comes, have to reschedule to the next day). She text me yesterday saying we needed to reschedule. I responded with my normal ""Kay :("" but she never replied with a time. I'm basically playing the waiting game today to see if she realizes she forgot me.

She looks at her phone during session a lot. She's said she hates doing it/tries not to, but every session she seems to stop and reply to a text of some kind. She apologizes, but I always lie and say ""its fine"" because I can never bring myself to telling someone when they upset me. She knows this too. 

She runs late. I HATE the waiting room. If I'm early, I will sit in my car right until my time. But then I end up waiting 20 minutes because she can't seem to get the people before me out on time, but then she always manages to get me out ""on time"". 

I've become so torn. I know I shouldn't stand for this shit, but when we are actually talking she's usually right. It was so hard to find a therapist because everyone wants parents. In my state they don't NEED parental consent since I'm over the age of 16. But I can't tell my parents and that's a wayyy longer story that's really nonnegotiable at this point.

I started cutting when I was 14, stopped at 17 but switched to other, less visible, ways of self harming (like biting my lips, cheeks, and cuticles, hitting myself, and other stuff). Two weeks ago, the pressure got too big and I cut my thigh in hopes nobody would see it. Unfortunately my mom did and she is seriously and understandably worried. She wants me to see a therapist, which I've tried, but haven't found the right one (on one hand I don't want some freudian depth analysis and on the other hand I wanted to fit it into my work schedule because I originally didn't want my employer to know). Now my mom suggested in-patient treatment, because she's worried I might hurt myself even more. I know, that this would definitely result in having to tell my boss, but I also know that at my current state it could be the best thing to do. I'm just not really sure if I should consider it. What do you guys think? Has anybody of you been in in-patient treatment? How did it work out for you? Better than ""normal"" sessions? How was the time after? Were you able to pick up your old job?

__________________________________________________

My upbringing was pretty bad. We were always tight on money anyway, but my mom's boyfriend (my step-dad) wasted pretty much all of it on fruit machines and pointless things, which made life all the more stressful for both of us. She dumped him eventually and found a new guy, the dad of my little brother, who was really aggressive towards both of us.

He would drink beer, smoke illegal stuff, play video games, bring his weird mates over and smoke more illegal stuff with them, all while not working that much and treating my mom like crap. He would call her names and threaten to hurt her whenever they argued, but there were times when he actually did hurt us/himself.

He literally knocked the wall separating my room and the hallway down twice, the front door was slammed so much that it won't even close properly now (which is terrifying, we don't live in the best of areas and all you need to do is kick the damn thing and you're in) so you just need to pull up the handle and hope that nobody wants in, he *accidentally* threw an old mallet head at my mom; she needed stitches and still has a scar there, he poured freezing cold water over my head because I peed the bed a few times as a kid too.

At one point he went at his arms/back and the kitchen doorway with a knife out of anger, I think he ended up getting stitches. While we were doing up the garden we found a machete bundled up under ground, but like I said, we were in a bad area so it wasn't necessarily his. 

The police were called a lot and he eventually left, I can't remember for the life of me what happened but he's out and about with a new girlfriend and was allowed to see my brother in a controlled environment every now and then, but the place they went to shut down and he was in charge of rearranging it, he didn't so we forgot about him.

My mom still isn't back to normal now that he's gone. The house is just about livable in, she's hooked on whatever he smoked, her MS is getting worse and can't live without the smoke, so it's just this huge vicious cycle of her getting stressed out about money, getting ill, needing smoke, and then stressing out about money she's wasted on smoke again and again. My younger brother has anger issues which are part way getting sorted out, and then there's my problems.

High school was terrible. I have long dark hair and in the first year of school I would usually go in with it greasy, I couldn't make myself wash it or myself (will be explained later, kind of), which they didn't let me live down for the next 3 years at all. I can't really explain it, there were so many tiny incidents like people making snide comments about me or ewing/booing me in the halls on a daily basis that the negative atmosphere just kind of built up until I couldn't stand it anymore, my attendance started to drop and as a result I lost all my friends, it was just horrible.

I haven't been to school for over a year, I just can't do it. Not only the people, but the overall atmosphere of school itself is too much for me. I constantly worried about doing something wrong or not being 'good enough' for other people, the school kept saying that if I didn't go in my mom would be fined which just added to the stress, there were so many expectations and boundaries and just, everything about school, how it works, the system behind it, *everything*, just stressed me out to the point where I would walk home crying and seriously consider just jumping out in front of a car.

Now I just can't go out of the house. It just doesn't feel safe or right, it sounds really, really stupid but I just feel like something bad is going to happen, or something is out to get me and that it'll hurt me and my family and I'll lose them and I just can't do it. In the back of my head I sometimes feel like I'm just being a moron and worrying about nothing, but for the most part, I just can't convince myself otherwise and it's ruining my life.

I also hear voices/see things that obviously aren't there. Talking among themselves, laughing, clicking their teeth, humming, calling me things like a slut, whore, idiot, failure, moron, ugly, telling me to jump in front of cars, saying that I'm no good/that I'm going to end up 'getting my mom killed' (I don't really know what that means), and I'll also hear somebody quickly running up the stairs and then suddenly stopping at my door a couple of times a day. I also see 3 'people' with animal heads (An owl, a goat, a deer), they don't really do anything or say anything bad, they just stand around doing nothing or might wander about the house. 

I can't even remember when I started seeing them or hearing things, I never really acknowledged them start, they've just kind of always been there all the time. The voices aren't even people I know, they're just kinda there. 

Now, these next things are things that I haven't fully explained to my carers or friends because I can't really put it into words, so I've never really told anybody before;

Sometimes I'll feel like somebody's in danger and that I *need* to talk to them, that I need to be with them to look after them or make sure they're okay. Usually it's my mom, I remember it happening a lot as a kid, I would cry until my nan (Whom I mostly live with) would call her for me because I felt like she was dead or being attacked.

Usually somebody will do something and it'll just click in my head that x person is in some sort of danger and that I need to talk to them, it usually happens when my nan is pottering about in my room tidying up. 

She could just start moving my stuff about to make it tidier and it's just, no I put that there so that mom wouldn't get hit by a car or get stabbed, no if you put it like that my aunt is going to get ill and die, it's just this nagging feeling all the time whenever somebody does something like that and I have absolutely no clue why.

I'll just keep it to myself and ignore what's happening, I just kind of let that one thought go on and on and on and I usually end up crying and worrying and then having a panic attack which makes me even MORE worried and it's just impossible to live with.

It's so weird to explain because it sounds so dumb and irrational and I *know* that these people are absolutely fine but at the same time, what if they aren't? What if I do need to talk to them for them to be okay? It's just in the back of my head all the time, worrying and worrying me.  

I also get these weird ideas, I don't really know what to call them. I can't bath because I feel like something will attack me, I can't wash my hair over the bath because I feel like something will grab me, I just get these overwhelming feelings and I can't look after my own hygiene at all. I just don't feel up to do anything. I genuinely don't feel the need to eat, drink, change my clothes, tidy things, socialize, bathe, or just generally look after myself, all I really want to do is sleep and be on my own.

I've had a counselor before, but she was really condescending and always interrupted me, I just couldn't stand her. I couldn't change counselors so I was kinda stuck with her. I eventually stopped being able to go, so the mental health service I was with let me talk to a psychiatrist instead. She blamed the things I see on 'tricks of the light' and the voices are just 'my thoughts', so that was an absolute waste of time.

I agreed to see my counselor one more time, but then they decided that they couldn't help and that I wasn't co operating so they stopped talking to me. We then had to wait AGES for a referral to go through for a systemic therapy group? multisystemic something? I don't really know. 

When we finally got to see them, they said that they didn't know why the previous people contacted them, they couldn't help so they've sent a referral BACK to the people who I saw to begin with, and the person who I have to see is apparently the psychiatrist from before.

It's just a huge mess and I can't cope with it. I'm going in circles with these mental health groups who seem to want nothing to do with me, I have a tutor who's really nice that I'm trying to do work for which is something, but it's not much. I just want to disappear, I can't cope with any of this, too many people asking too many things of me in such a small space of time, I'm just not cut out for it. I don't know what to do anymore, really. 

I don't know how to deal with the anxiety or the hallucinations or any of the other stuff, nobody has tried to give me ways to deal with it, they just tell me to get on with it because ""that's life :)"" and it's my fault that I'm like this, I just want to end everything and just stop wasting people's time.

Just stopping in here for some general advice and what not. 

There's a lot of stuff i do that kind of has me worried about my sanity. I don't want to be a dick and waste anyones time but I'm seriously worrying that i might be getting worse and worse and I'm sort of becoming aware that i might be a danger to my own or someone elses health soon.

I've been thinking about myself lately and i have started to realize that my behaviour isn't very typical, or at least it doesn't seem to be very typical according to how I view other peoples behaviour. But also i'm kind of thinking i might just be imagining or at least over reacting to nothing.

I decided that I'ld make a list tonight and if you guys think there is some sort of trouble you could give me some advice on what to do, maybe see someone or something.

I don't think I am dangerous. I just don't know if i can trust myself anymore.

* I'm easily distracted, and it's hard for me to focus on specific things
* I talk to myself out loud without realising it
* I make jokes in my head only i get and then i laugh out loud to them
* I can talk to strangers, the same as i can talk to people I have always known.
* Sometimes I hear voices in my head, They aren't hostile or anything, last time i heard one it just kept saying some guys name over and over, but in an encouraging voice, as if it was the guys dad cheering him on in a running race
* Sometimes i blank out and then wake up in another place
* Sometimes the world can look terrifyingly beautiful
* I can't think about things for too long or I wil get struck with how just wonderful everything is
* I think i can trick gravity and the wind and stuff like that
* I have no friends at all, by choice
* I think I love everybody
* I have to do some things a lot more than i have to because i think my senses lie to me.
* I cry at others pain
* I am honestly convinced that this might be not real, or I might not be real
* I keep helping strangers without expecting anything in return
* I think about things for hours on end and than think about something else
* I like feeling all the emotions like happiness and anger and sorrow
* I do things without knowing why.
* I don't hide my intentions or emotions, even if i know it will harm me.
* I don't have any desire to become something other than happy, which i am now

Most worrying of all is that I am usually unaware any of these things are happening and i think it's getting worse and worse. I'm not on drugs or anything, I'm 18 and I wasn't abused or anything when i was growing up. Parents loved eachother and me. 

I just feel like the part of me that's connected to the writing the letter and stuff is slowly becoming disconnected to the other part and I think some day soon I'm going to lose this part all together you feel?

Can someone make sense of what is happening to me and give me some advice on what to do?

A few years ago I would sometimes get panic attacks. I told my doctor but she said if it wasn't really affecting me then she wouldn't prescribe medication. She recommended that I just take deep breaths when I feel a panic attack coming on. After that, when I went back for checkups and she asked about the panic attacks I told her I was fine because I felt like she just brushed me off the first time I told her anything I felt wrong. Now I am not sure if I should confide in her or if I need to go to a doctor, except my boyfriend tells me I should.

Sometimes in addition to feeling really scared I also feel really down and frustrated. This is followed by me breaking down and having an overwhelming sense of numbness/indifference for anywhere form a couple to several hours. I lose motivation to do anything productive, including eating, and usually by the end of the episode I'm so exhausted. This has been occurring more often recently, with no apparent trigger - I don't think I'm especially stressed right now. Whenever this happens I feel the urge to be alone because I feel nervous and overwhelmed by the people around me, and more than once I had to walk away in a public place.

I don't know what this is or if it's serious enough to tell my doctor. I'm scared of telling her because personally this is hard for me to express and she might say it's not serious enough for her to consider/brush it off and I'll feel stupid for bringing it up. I have only opened up to my boyfriend, partially because I have broken down in front of him before.

These are some of the symptoms I feel like I'm experiencing:

- Dropping out of activities and life in general

This one is a little bit of a stretch but I started dropping out of tennis when I was 17. Although, I am starting to do much less school work because I feel very little motivation. I have motivation for the future, I want to be successful and earn a lot of money and eventually learn how to and develop games.

- Social isolation- few close friends if any. Little interaction outside of immediate family.
- Increased withdrawal, spending most of the days alone.

- Becoming lost in thoughts and not wanting to be disturbed with human contact

I have friends although I do have a hard time getting to be close with them. I believe I am quite lonely although if I want to, I can hang out with my friends whenever. For the past weeks though, I have been having very little social interaction outside my family. The thing is, I have absolutely no problem being alone. I'm not sure if I'm just introverted. I consider myself to be an easy going person while having a good sense of humor and I believe I can make friends easily but I just don't feel like hanging out with them even if I enjoy spending time with them. Most of my time is right now spent alone in front of my computer trying new things like learning how to code but I am bad at fulfilling that task which is also another symptom

 - Directionless- lack goals, or the ability to set and achieve goals

I understand that this is something that can be normal for people but I'm just putting it here since it is a symptom

 - Neglect in self-care- i.e. hygiene, clothing, or appearance

This one I have been noticing lately. My family say that I do smell but I don't really mind it although I do take showers whenever they tell me that I smell.


If I were to point out the symptoms that I feel I can relate to the most, it would be: 

 - Social isolation- few close friends if any. Little interaction outside of immediate family.
 - Increased withdrawal, spending most of the days alone.

 - Replaying or rehearsing conversations out loud- i.e. talking to yourself (very common sign)

I got the most fright out of reading this symptom because I am not sure if this is normal. I don't do this regularly but it does happen sometimes, I would say rarely.

I don't have hallucinations or delusions though or so I believe but they're not exactly symptoms of developing schizophrenia, they're more as symptoms of schizophrenia.

Any help is would be extremely appreciated since I got a bit of sudden anxiety reading the whole list of symptoms so any clarification would really help me out

this hasn't happened recently, but this was a period of time which sometimes i just had a strong urge to hurt something.

there was once i was sitting beside the diner table at my home. there was a knife set beside me as i was browsing on the internet. then i had an urge so bad that i just wanted to pick up that knife, and just cut off my hand. i just wanted to see what's inside, the bone, the blood, the muscle, the everything. i got so scared that i had to throw that knife out of my sight and run to my room. i was about 14 at this time.

there had also been a few occurrence which i just wanted to grab something sharp and just attach someone.

at that time i just wrote it off as been a stupid kid, but is this normal?

also, i've never really talked about this with anyone (reasons below). i feel like since i've always oppressed the idea of talking, i have these thoughts stored in myself. there just feel like a dark swamp of all these dark thoughts inside me.

i felt like i don't belong in this world (not suicidal), but sometimes i would wake up and felt like this life i have is just simply a chapter in a book/comic. i am only living in a story. when i come across topics that should be sad/impacting, i just feel indifferent. for example, i never understood why rape/rape jokes is a bad thing (not i'm encouraging it), i just felt...indifferent. i don't understand why people would get mad after i said something; to me, it would just be a comment, but it became hurtful to them.

I read a lot of manga, i feel like that's the world i live in. it is only in the world of science fiction that i find happiness/sad/concerned or anything.

something about me:

i've never really had good things done to me by guys. (not sure how to put this but this does not involve affection)

when i was little, i was teased a lot by my uncles/cousins (male) about my name because it can be read and interpreted in different ways in my native language.

when i was in grade 3-6, i was constantly teased for my weight by mostly the guys in my class. the teacher/my parents never intervened and i was left pretty much alone.

during grade 7-8 i moved to north america, and my dad stayed back in my homeland. at this point, my mom was pregnant with my baby brother (~12 years younger than me). so during this time, i didn't got any help from either of my parents and i was forced to mature fast and  carry some of the loads at home. i felt even more alone at this point.

I had gone back to my homeland once during this period and i felt rather distant from my relatives. 

during this trip, i had, at one point, tried to help a guy who was on his bike and murmuring something like ""i can't"", and being a helpful person i walked up closed to check on him. at this point, two of my cousins i was walking with fled, leaving me alone with this man. then, he had reached down to his crotch and had took out his penis. i fled in horror.

then my dad came to stay with us, and we had fought constantly because he still holds the eastern view for female and i was outright rejecting it with my ""whitewashed"" views. also, my dad rarely care about my well-being, his primary interest was what my marks are in school. i had been called so many different name by him that i lost count. i suck at english, and he knows, but even if i get an above average mark, he would not be happy. he had gotten mad at me for getting 76 in english, and 86 in physics (IB) because they were ""not high enough"". sometimes he would be in this mood for days and will keep on bring it up for as long as he remembers or when someone mentions marks. i would always be scared during these times. i have been hit, verbally abused, even shut into a toilet for hours by him, and he would always threaten me to not make this know by anyone else. and my mom would be just there, looking, not even trying to do anything.

i haven't talked to anyone about this. because what i had gone through in elementary, i had believed that the only thing adults will do is either look at you cold-eyes, or smother you with kind word and would not try to help you.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Hey guys, I'm kinda scared of what is going on with me"

I need a fresh perspective.  Basically, my Mom has had depression her whole life, I absolutely love and cherish her as do her other children.  We all love her.   Where I am coming from: I am well into adulthood now and have accomplished some life goals, most people would say I came out pretty well.  I live not so terribly close to her but I manage to see her regularly every month or so. 

My issue: my Mom has struggled with manic-depressive, later diagnosed as bipolar, for my entire life (that I can remember).  She's been on meds for my entire existence.  She had a really, really shitty up bringing.  Some terrible things happened but she was really smart and used to be an amazing person (deliberate use of past tense there).   

Because they, doctors, didn't know how to treat psychosis back in the day, they prescribed these super-duper heavy sedatives.  Because of those, she gained a ton of weight.   Fast-forward thirty years or so.   She's been overweight well more than half her life, has a slew of related obesity problems.  She uses food as an outlet and she knows it.   Because of other problems (and probably years of the sedative drugs), she's not as mentally quick as she used to be.   Aaaand, She's really, really incredibly impulsive.  Terrible with money or food.  If she's hungry, she'll quickly eat a whole bag of chips or cookies or whatever.  If she's bored, she'll quickly purchase whatever she can't afford on credit.  

She really needs to exercise.   All her Dr's say it.   Last year she survived a near-death experience and was motivated for a couple months.  It's been a year since.   She doesn't walk, she complains all the time.  So many of these problems would be solved if she would just walk or exercise for 30 mins - 1 hr a day!  She would lose weight, her health problems would be under control.   It's so frustrating because she'll spend time doing sedentary activities all day or driving to dr's appointments and then be ""too tired"" to go walk or exercise.  

Now, the heart of the matter is that I want her to be healthy but I can't stand talking to her and she calls and calls all the time. When she calls me she just complains and whines about her day or phantom health problems (she's a huge hypochondriac).   And, it's so frustrating to have conversations like:

Her: Complaining
Me:  What else did you do today?
Her: Went to the store, looked on computer, watched TV, other sedentary things
Me: Why don't you go for a walk?  If you go for a walk you'll feel better.
Her: I'm too tired.  It's too late (5pm --8pm, still light out).  

When I visit, the house is messy and she just doesn't ""care.""  The problem is that I really dread talking with her because it brings my mood down.  She calls me multiple times a day.   Everyday.  Even when I feel like I do my ""due diligence"" and talk with her for 20 minutes in the morning or during lunch, she'll still call in the evening.   And, I get so frustrated asking why she doesn't walk and talk maybe?  Why doesn't she use the recumbent bike we bought her (AND placed right infront of the TV??) when she wants to chat.   Mainly, why is it always so depressing to talk with her?  She hardly ever has anything upbeat to ever say besides complaining about something.

What can I do, short of not speaking with her?  She always has new health ailments too.   So, it's one of those things she uses to get my attention, like she might pass on from some form of life threatening cancer that turns out to be non-cancer.  

Recently, I've started being short with her on the phone and just saying I've gotta go.  Because, I don't want to be frustrated and have my own mood brought down listening to all this complaining.  

I'm looking for a little help about how to deal with this situation.  I'm the only one who still tries to motivate her (and I've really, really, and still do try).  I just want her to be happy and healthy!  But, from the phone calls, I need some better mental way to cope from speaking with her, that doesn't make me depressed or irritated.

Also, they believe there may have been some sexual abuse. My wife calls Lisa every day, and when she tries to ask Lisa about any sexual assault, Lisa will just say ""What's in the past is past.""

There is a lot going on here, and Lisa is refusing to help herself. She refuses all medication, and will not volunteer any information about what may have happened to her. She sees her doctor every day, and has constant supervision in the ward she is in. 

One thing she does say is that she doesn't feel like she is worth the effort everyone is putting in to helping her. She says she feels worthless, and has alluded to some ""bad things"" she did. Whether this means something sexual, or just some teenage pranks, we can't figure out. We do know she has experimented with drugs, and she has said she ""loves to take pills.""

My daughter and I recently made the 4.5 hour trip up to see Lisa, and she seemed to genuinely be happy to see us. However, the next day when we asked her if our visit had done anything to help her, Lisa said no, it made no difference at all.

I'm currently being treated for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Paranoia, Insomnia, General panic attacks and dramatic mood changes through the public psychiatric services in Ireland. I've had two appointments, one evaluation for two hours, and one light hearted 40 minute conversation with a consultant. The first time I was prescribed an anti-psychotic alongside my Sertraline with a taper onto fluoxetine, but then the consultant asked me to cease the antipsychotic because (and I'm just garnering this from the conversation we had, it wasn't explicitly said) he believes there might be some traumatic / psychological root in it. I had a brilliant childhood, and was the life of the party not 5 months ago. Now I can't leave the house. I made the choice to quit valium after picking up my prescription as I'd only been on it four weeks and already noticed my own psychological dependance on it, nip it in the bud before it became something more. In those brief three days between the assessment the atypical antipsychotic really worked. It didn't stop my mood swings or depression but it helped me get back in touch with reality and completely ceased some of my obsessions (but not all, just ones like every brown spec being faeces). I also told what I want to call half truths but were frankly lies in the assessment that I have to go remedy on Monday. Namely have you had suicidal thoughts / have you harmed yourself. The former being a failed attempt and consistent planning and the latter being regularly to reclaim a bit of control over what's happening to me. I lied out of fear of being committed due to the extensive research I've done, down to the mathematics. (It started out as me cutting my thighs in hopes that I could convince myself brown specs were just dried blood). I have a bright future that I just can't see, studying computer science and business and getting great grades. I'm not asking for encouragement (I can only imagine how many rules that would break) but as I've been prescribed these medications legally and I'm taking them regardless as I see fit just for this weekend, I'm curious - has anybody else ever found themselves in a similar situation?

I have zero internal compartmentalization. I am completely the same person in all contexts of my life, which is 100% authentic even when it's inappropriate. While most people can tune their personality to resonate as much as possible with others, I generally am unsuccessful when I try to do so. The few people with whom I have enough overlap are few and far between and live far away.

The problem is that people seem to get exhausted by this authenticity. Because the interface to my personality is not very flexible, it's like a puzzle piece that has very specific, rare interfacing. When I try to be flexible with my personality I am successful at connecting but... I get exhausted quickly.

I have basically had this my entire life and the lack of personal interfacing ultimately ends up feeling like rejection. It's getting worse because I am developing a lot of anger. People generally don't want to be around an angry person. Oddly enough I'm often described as ""chill.""

My neighbor is a psychiatrist and we get along well enough as neighbors. After explaining this to them they said that I'm healthy, particularly because I'm aware of these issues. But, then, is it possible that a highly functional, healthy person produces dysfunction when interacting with other people who are less so?

I feel like I need help but I'm terrified of sorting through dozens of expensive psychiatrists who... don't relate to me. I don't know where to start. It'd be nice to even know what this phenomenon is called. It's kind of the opposite of Borderline. What to do?

----

I was abused by my peers as a kid because I have always been pretty different and haven't had the same values or priories as others. By the time I was in my late teens I had come to the realization that I couldn't be anything other than myself. As long as I am 100% authentic I will at least never have to apologize to myself.

In my early 20s I started meditating. I was practicing a sort of unsupervised Jnana Yoga wherein you release association with the self and instead associate with everything at large. This felt great and was a relief from the highly fortified ego I had established. This went on for a few years. Sometimes I would meditate six hours a day. In general, probably around 2005, I would say that I ""succeeded"". I had no sense of self. If someone walked by me I would make eye contact and immediately relate with them. I went on a date with a woman who asked me to tell her about myself and I couldn't provide an answer. I could only describe things that I did, not what I am.

A couple years went by and I found that this manner of existence was not particularly compatible with life as we know it. I began to put my personality back together.

Nowadays I do a good job of living like a normal person. I have this consistent personality that is more or less like the one I had before my meditation. It's consistent and completely authentic. The main difference is that now I don't identify directly with the personality like I did before meditation, but it's close enough.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I have zero compartmentalization.

I constantly move. I've lived in 3 different states in the past three years. My behavior is incredibly impulsive. I never think before I do things. I just do it. It's caused me a lot of grief. These behaviors are also all tied in with my childhood. I've went to multiple elementary schools, multiple middle schools, and multiple high schools. There would be times I would throw fits because I wouldn't want to go to school, this started in elementary school and progressed until I dropped out of high school. 

I do have anxiety, but I'm a social person. I can't decide if this is just me being a lazy asshole that has some bad habits, or a bigger problem. If anyone has some advice, or if you're in a similar situation, please PM me. I feel like my behavior is self defeating. It's getting the best of me. I have high expectations, and I just can't seem to get it right. It's effecting EVERYTHING.

My parents teach at a university in Tanzania. A year and a half ago, a student in our department (which is relatively small, around 30 students) started to become extremely paranoid. Visions, hearing voices, stuff like that. She came to us about it and we agreed to take her in.

If she was experiencing any of this before, she was really great at hiding it. She went from a mostly happy person to a paranoid and timid person. Not to say that she's never happy anymore, but she was a lot more cheerful back before this started.

Anyways, back to the chain of events. She started keeping her phone off at all times and didn't want to let anyone see her except for us. She stayed in her room most of the time, although she was very helpful around the house. Shortly after she started staying with us, she graduated, and we agreed to let her continue to stay with us for a while longer. She continued to be very seclusive, although she has opened up a little now.

A short while later she started leaving to go someplace (we don't know where, she described it to me recently as her ""safe place"") and she claimed to have started to receive messages from God. Some were relatively harmless, but others harmed her (not physically). For example, shortly after graduating, she got a wonderful job opportunity, and we went through all this work helping her quit her old job. Soon after, though, she got a ""message"" telling her to NOT take the job, and so she immediately turned it down.

That was queer, but the queerest thing that happened was a few months ago (around Easter IIRC), when she suddenly decided to change her name. It was quite surprising to us. She absolutely refuses to answer to her old name at all, except for people who hadn't yet been notified of the change (who she immediately notified). There wasn't really that much of a personality change that came with the name change, however; it seems that it was just her name that changed.

Anyways, currently she is living with us, going by her new name only, still pretty timid, still disappearing every afternoon. She is a little more open now, going places with us occasionally, etc, and she seems to generally act okay most of the time - by just talking to her you wouldn't think anything's wrong with her. In terms of relatives, her father is dead, her mother is, I'm told, mentally ill, and she was raised and cared for by her aunt as a child. She is 32 years old.

**The situation:**

(to avoid confusion I will henceforth refer to our friend as ""M"")

M's aunt somehow got wind of M's suspected illness - either through a concerned ex-roommate of M's, or simply figuring it out herself with M's phone being off and such. She told us that she would come to pick M up and take her (home I guess). We think that something does need to happen before M makes to many bad decisions, and this ""intervention"" may be the right thing. We managed to avoid confrontation tonight due to some campus rule about not being allowed to take people from campus in the evening or something, and we're supposed to take M to a safe location (local police station) to ""transfer"" M to her aunt in the morning.

Keep in mind that M, at this point in time, doesn't know anything. Apparently the last time her aunt came, her hands started to shake uncontrollably. I didn't know about this previous visit until a few minutes ago, so if more information is needed in this respect I'll ask.

Now, she trusts us (I'm pretty sure), but she might become uneasy about being suddenly asked to come with us in the car. We do NOT want to do a ""trick"" or lie to get her to the station, but we're unsure how to go about this another way.

**Please:**

* Are we doing the right thing?

* If so, are there any suggestions on how to get M to come? Do we tell her what's happening right away and hope she doesn't resist? Tricks/lies are not an option, that's just wrong.

* If not, what should we do? Some sort of ""intervention"" does need to happen before the situation gets out of hand. The name change and turning down the great job opportunity may just be the start.

* Does this sound like schizophrenia or something else?

I'm posting this at 10:30PM local time, at around 7-7:30 AM tomorrow morning a decision has to have been made. We just really want more opinions on what needs to happen, as tonight my father already consulted with many people, including the head of the campus guards, the provost, and another teacher.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,We have a friend staying with us who we think has schizophrenia.

He texted a few of us in our circle of friends some really heartfelt messages about loving us and remembering how good of friends we have been.  I asked if he was okay and he said he was great, and just showing love.  He posted a few random pics on instagram with strange captions.  Then when me and him were hanging out, he kinda had a heart to heart convo with me, which is unlike him.  He's very shut in, unemotional, always seemingly happy/content.  This was the first time in our 15 year friendship he had shown some cracks in his exterior.  He was acting kind of spacey, and odd.  Even his brother said so.  After about a week, he seemed back to normal.

Then it started over in the past couple days.  He was acting a little spacey the other day, and then starting earlier today, he went on a picture posting spree on instagram, almost 30 pics in one day.  Some of them really random with strange captions.  He's usually very particular about the pics he posts, edits them a lot, etc.  These were just unfiltered plain pics of weird shit.

So I met up with another close friend to talk about it, and he showed me a direct message he sent him on instagram earlier today.  It was to him, another friend that passed from cancer earlier this year, and his widow.  It had a long caption starting off with ""hey boo"", and saying things like ""the view is great from up here and I'm always watching over you"", and ended it with ""love you babe"".  Almost as if he was speaking from the deceased friend's point of view.  It was really strange and awkward.

Then later on this evening, they were hanging out at another friend's house and everybody said he was acting strange, and kept washing his face every 10 minutes.

We're all really worried, and I don't really know what to do from here.  Some things of note:

* his dad has a history of mental health issues, but we thought from PTSD (he was a military man).
* he was taking some sort of weight loss supplement like Hydroxycut.  We attributed the first weird week to that.  Another friend said he tried it and he was acting spacey for a few days so he stopped.
* he's never really had a girlfriend, and in the past year he's been talking to a girl constantly, and I'm not a fan because she's taking advantage and friend-zoning him, he's the nicest guy in the world.  He recently bought her an expensive watch even though he's struggling financially.  Of course, he's closed in and won't really vent about it.
* he's very religious, and a lot of his random captions and messages are super religious and creepy.
* I don't know the details, but about 10 years ago he was at fault in an accident that hurt somebody.  He's never told me about it, but apparently it weighs very heavy on him.  He's a really good person and it was a complete accident.

I'm just hoping it's something stupid like the supplement making him spacey and post weird shit. Does anyone have any advice for this situation?  Any experience that seems similar?  Anything?

I haven't heard anything since yesterday afternoon.  Did manage to get the puppy back.  I feel stuck, like I can't move on until I know what's going to happen with him and when he will be released.

We were in a an 8 mo. relationship, and very much in love.  The relationship had it's problems, but nothing that I was truly worried about.

Then he got a new job that turned his world upside-down financially.  He has never experienced financial insecurity.  I think that, and getting injured and strep throat at work really messed with his self confidence.  I think this is what made him snap.

One day he started talking and he never stopped.  It's gone on for weeks.  First, it started with an epiphany that he had about his learning style.  Then, he wanted to quit school and his two decent jobs (completely out of character from what I've been told and what I know about him) to start a non-profit, or a foundation, no wait, a consulting firm.  When you were with him, it wasn't a conversation it was a sermon about how you should believe in him.  Any subject you brought up, he found a way to relate it to his message, to his vision.  If you wouldn't listen to his tangents and preaching, you were ""cut-off"".  He proceeded to cut me off, even though at this point I wanted nothing to do with the madness, then his twin brother, multiple friends, and today, his mother (after telling her she was the reason his eldest brother was dead, she couldn't handle speaking to him anymore...we were trying to get him someplace so that the police could help).

He lost the new job, likely because he took more time talking to customers about his idea, than doing his job.  Then, he was sent home from the job that he's had for 7 years.  I was told that he came in 3 hours late, in street clothes, to talk about his ideas to the managers and tell them he's not crazy.  The situation escalated, and he has likely lost that job as well.

Oh, let's get back to his interactions with myself and other females.  During one of his tirades, of which became increasingly more destructive, he told me he had lied to me when we got together, that he had played me.  He locked himself in my bathroom and told me he hadn't been eating, or sleeping, that he didn't care if he died for his message to get out. It then turned into him not trusting white people (he is black, I'm white) that I had cheated on him and never thought of him as a man, that he wanted me to hurt.  Then he told all of his female friends the same thing, sending upwards of 100 texts messages at once of incoherent blabber and threats about me and about them.  They had to escort me home last night because of one text he sent ""Look at okapibutt's house right now"".  Luckily he had done nothing to my place, nor was he there once we got there.  I was shaking at this point.  I've had a lot of experience with ""crazy"" and all types of abuse, but never true mental illness.

One of the shittiest parts is that he and I rescued a puppy just shortly before his change began.  She was doing wonderfully, and then he took her with him.  I do know that the friend he's been staying with has been taking good care of her, and that she was attacked by a neighbor's dog and had to be taken to the vet.  I practically had to pull teeth to get that info.  

Today,I took the day off from work and finally got to talk to his mother and brother about getting him help.  The police were able to take him into custody once we finally found him, and his brother (not sure why this happened) let an office manager at their apartment complex take the puppy home for the night.  I hope to get her back tomorrow.  Not sure what will happen if my ex is released and he finds out I have her, but I'll worry about that later.

Uggggggggh what a huge huge shocking loss.  Everyone is so worried about him.  I'm pretty sure he once told me that his biological mother was bipolar.  I'm thinking he's manic right now. He's blaming a lot of this on being adopted, which if he was in the right state of mind, would be bullshit.

There are so many little details I'm sure I've left out, but like I said, he has said so many confusing and horrible things lately...

Advice, stories, whatever's appreciated

TL;DR After an 8 month relationship he experienced a sudden change, became a complete stranger to me and the people closest to him.  He became a danger to himself and others. I think he may be having a manic episode.

There was at once a feeling of aimless anxiety and fear and panic - not about anything in particular, just this incredibly unwell feeling, and it was so alarming I ran around my house and bashed my head into pillows. I hoped it would all go away, as salvia leaves the body entirely within an hour. It never went away. I'm sure the problems that follow were ""built-in"" for me and may/may not have come out otherwise, but this is what ripped them straight to the forefront of my psyche. 

I have obsessional, intrusive negative thoughts that pervade everything I do, at all times of every single day. They are most typically nebulous, and fly by in flashes, but the ""aura"" of anxiety around them is incredibly strong. There are high-intensity times where they stop being nebulous and start coming more into focus and that is absolutely terrifying. They last for weeks or months at a time, making thinking about anything else impossible. They've gone from being about my derealization, to sexuality, to violence. I often think about what it would be like to kill the person I'm next to, to push them down the stairs, to do terrible things to animals. This combined with my derealization, the kind that takes the ""life"" away from everything, is unimaginably difficult to deal with.

My derealization came on as well from the accident. It has taken away the ""life"" or ""color"" from everything. I'll look at something beautiful and realize it's just chemicals, or I'll look at a friend and despite having an ordinary, pleasant conversation, I'll think about how they're just a horrifying bag of meat with weird eyeballs and muscles and gross guts acting on survivalistic urges. It takes away the spirit from everything, it makes everything artificial and meaningless and disgusting. It's not how I WANT to think, but it's the lens through which my mind interprets everything, and combined with the purely obsessional OCD it's incredibly distressing and it makes me not just so disconnected from the magic of reality here, but also so, so scared of my mind and what I'm capable of doing. Looking at meat makes me very uncomfortable. Anatomy books are like nightmare fuel.

From the salvia forward, I have an encompassing extreme anxiety - not about anything in particular, there's nothing I'm anxious ""about"" - just an extreme paralytic ""nervous"" feeling. I believe it's partially related to feeling like I am crazy or unwell or that I may become unstable at any moment, but that ""anxiety"" started the very second the salvia accident began. That aimless coating of a feeling has never gone away. I haven't had a sense of well being in four years. This makes every second of every single hour that I'm awake uncomfortable at best and agonizing at worst.

If I'm not engaged with something at all times, my mind zeroes in on those thoughts and that anxiety and amplifies them intensely. This makes going to bed a dangerous, scary race between my thoughts and falling asleep.

I could not finish high school. I could not hold onto a single job I got. It has gotten worse and worse over the years with no sign of recovery. I've been to several different hospitals over and over again, and they've collectively done nothing. I didn't get help for years because I was led to believe the medical industry was evil, was out to get me, etc etc etc., and because I simply had no idea where to go. Every hospital I ever went to was stumped, told me I had ""anxiety"" and sent me home.

I've tried over and over and over again as hard and as best as I can. I can barely function in my day to day life. My mind is an absolute living nightmare. I have no memory, I hardly sleep, I cannot focus, being awake is like being in complete mental anguish. I hear horrible demonic thoughts, reality hasn't existed for me since 2010, time is in constant distortion, I cannot keep track of even simple tasks. I could not complete highschool because of this. I haven't been able to hold any job for longer than a month. I can barely get through each day alive. I had been homeless for four years, and I am now on a couch, and I am deeply upset being a burden to them. I've been going to this place called Harbor Homes for therapy but they've done practically nothing since January (they're meant for homeless youth - the only place I can afford). None of the meds I've been on (so far) have worked. What do I do in the meantime besides sit and shake and cry and hold it in further and try not to kill myself from the agony?

One of the worst parts is that when this is happening - the worst it gets, the more quiet I get, the further into my head I go. There's no outside signs, there's no shaking, no heavy breathing, no nothing. On the outside I am calm and docile, on the inside I am drowning, flaming and screaming. No one can ever tell, and so there's never been anyone any the wiser unless I tell them.

I've done this for so long, and I'm running out of options... The ones I have need to be extremely powerful, cover all hours of the day... Not that I'm not grateful for what I have, but I need SO much more help than what I'm getting, this is is a serious emergency...",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Please god help me.

His parents are afraid of him and his wife and daughter are distraught.  We need to get him medicated but I don’t know how.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Background:
Bill does not leave the house much and lives with and off the generosity of his parents.  He is extremely paranoid.  I don’t want to give too many specific examples because of the small chance that someone will recognize this, but he thinks very of very unrealistic conspiracies that are being perpetrated against him and tells everyone who disagrees that they are stupid.  He isn’t violent towards other people currently, but if he gets upset he is extremely destructive and breaks valuable items belonging to his parents.  He has a young daughter and a wife, who is currently out of the country visiting family and he now refuses to speak to her and no one knows why.  His behavior gets worse by the day and it frightens those that he is around.  
In the past, his parents convinced him once to visit a doctor who prescribed him some anti-depressants.  His behavior greatly improved, but about 6 months later it was discovered that the pills were affecting his testosterone, which made him angry and he quit taking them.  He now refuses to go to the doctor and has never acknowledged having a problem.  I fear that he is a danger to himself or those around him.
Everything that I have read says that someone close to him needs to gain his confidence and help him realize he has a problem.  The issue is that he distrusts everyone and everyone is afraid of his destructive outbursts and will not confront him.  For reasons I prefer not to go into, neither my wife nor I are in a position to intervene.

Dave is a combat Veteran of the 2003 Iraq War and witnessed some truly horrific things.  He was one of 3 surviving members of his unit when they were attacked in Sadr City.  Despite that he has always been a happy go lucky laid back person for as long as I have known him.  Recently he suffered a psychotic break and has been very manic/delusional (fox/cnn news is sending him coded messages through the TV) he also developed a messiah complex and is going to save America with ""teamwork"" he has contacted our state senator's office to give them his plan to save America.  He believes that his supporters are going to bring this change about.

I've seen Dave twice since his break.  The first time, about a week after his break, he was manic but I was told by his girlfriend that he was the calmest that he had been in days.  The second time was yesterday, his GF warned me that he had a really manic day and that I was probably not going to have a great time because he was going to be really talkative and was deeply immersed in his delusions.  When I got there Dave's attitude completely changed he was the man that we all knew.  It was a total 180 from the way that he had been acting.  He wasn't delusional, he watched the news without going into some conspiracy theory and he went to bed at 930pm which never happens.  He hadn't gone to sleep before 3 am in weeks.  He also slept in his bed with his GF which he hadn't done since his break, because ""If they get me I don't want them to get my gf too""

Before I ramble, I do not have any sort of god complex and in no way do i see myself above people, infact I'd say im lower than most.  within the past 2-3 years my life has just been one big experience of realising I dont think normally, whenever I go outside and see the world, I feel like im not ""one of these people"", I observe their behavior and it seems foriegn to me.  While I sometimes enjoy the observations, I cant help questioning why I do it, does anyone else do it, and is it sane to do it.  
A good example would be in a bar, (and for some reason alcohol and other substances amplify this disconnection to humanity.) I watch a group of friends, they are all wearing similar clothes, all have similar haircuts, and they are eyeing up females.  What goes through my head at such an observation is a mixture of things like: This place i'm in is just a breeding ground, humans are animals but they deny that fact, They have been brainwashed just like everyone else.  Are they even using their heads, Do they really like what they are.  And with each observation I feel even further away from these people.

After finishing school I fell into the drugs and alcohol scene and since then I have developed psychotic beliefs that always back up my observations.  I wont go into detail too much on the psychosis but I naturally believe that humans are supposed to be more than what we are at the moment.  I feel there is a higher power of elites that are weakening us into submission, food, water, the beliefs forced onto us,  all suppresors of our real power.

This revelation came while Tyson was reinventing himself as a boxing promoter. He also told Lauer that he had only been sober for 12 days at the time of the interview. After so many personal and professional ups and downs, it is unclear what will happen next for this legendary yet troubled sports figure.In 2012, Tyson made his Broadway debut in his one-man show Mike Tyson: The Undisputed Truth directed by Spike Lee.

**I am sorry for such an extremely long post.** I wanted to discuss this issue with somebody for years, but I can never get the right words in; I have hard time summing it up. Mainly because my mother is an extremely loving woman who would (probably literally) give me all she has plus her kidney if it could help me in life. Really, I know that one. So when all is good, I have hard time reconciling the image of her that I love with the image of the angry woman she is during her bursts. So now that another of those incidents happened, I thought I would just describe it word by word to you, to keep it as accurate as possible. I know people fight/get upset about small things all the time, but this...this can’t be normal, is it?       
**Background**: My mom is in her fifties, I am in my twenties. I don’t live at home permanently. My mom is pretty unhappy with her part of life (unfortunately, about things which can’t be changed at this point much), and so very much lives for me and through me. The issue: she has been easy to make very angry and bursting with anger episodes ever since I can remember as a kid. She always manages to control herself in front of an audience, but if nobody we know aside from me or grandma is watching, any little disagreement by her close ones (so me or our grandma) with her opinion or instruction can set her off. Random (bigger) examples I remember:         
1) I did a year away with a family member in the U.S., where I went to high school prom. I bought a dress she didn’t like (it was ‚not pretty‘, not like slutty or something inappropriate), and refused to wear a dress she bought for the occassion without consulting me two years ago. She got angry, called my relative, and told them that she cannot handle me and that I cannot come back to live with her, ever. She meant it for good two weeks.           
2) My mom and grandma serve every dish by putting one extra paper napkin under the plate, so it doesn’t ‚slide‘ on the tray. I never use that extra napkin and always just spill a random drop of food on it, so it goes to waste. So I like to remove the napkin before the food is served on the plate. A couple of years ago when the angry episodes were the most frequent because some underlying disagreements, me putting that napkin away and telling to my mom that I don’t need it when she insisted that I put it back made her so angry and desperate and teary that she grabbed a knife and asked me whether I would like to stab her right away, because one day I will kill her [meaning with my disagreements] anyway.      
And so on and so on it goes, but usually on a lesser scale of consequences – meaning no talk about me not ever coming home, etc, but instead her just calling out cusswords, getting really unhappy, hyperventilating, crying about how mean we are to her and how we on purpose don’t do things the way she wants us to for our own good, or going to sleep to calm herself down.      
         
Now, let me show you word by word what happened today. I figured this might be a good example to analyse her part because unlike some other times, I think I kept myself very collected and reasonable, and it still didn’t help at all. (Please feel free to tell me if you think that’s not true and I was not reasonable).Why is she like this? Is this some kind of illness? Surely that can’t be regular every day anger…?      
             
**Today:**      
Mom wants me to run some errands tomorrow morning - go buy a couple of things in one shop, then go and get my grandma's prescriptions.       
We write down the list of things to buy in the shop and a little map of where they are, as it's a big shop and I've never been there. All is cool.      
I am then handed the list of meds that I have to ask for my grandma. I put it in the other paper detailing what to buy. My mom calmly says don't do that, you will lose it.     
I calmly assure her that I won't, it's alright (*mistake 1: don't disagree with mom – seems like a simple rule, but when you try to do that 100% of time, it does get tricky*).     
She already gets visibly upset, in a sense of things not working out her way, and nervously raises voice: What the hell, I don't like this, you will totally lose this paper and then we will all never find out where it is. Then hands me a folder to carry it in. This already puts her in bad mood.    
Then seeing as I put that folder in my bag, she grabs the quite big book that I've been carrying around and says that I shouldn't carry this, as I have to do a lot of stuff that day and the book is heavy.       
*Now in retrospect, seeing my mom already turning nervous and upset, this is the place where I should say OK and shut the fuck up*. But no, me being me and just hoping that this exchange can end calmly, I go ""it's ok, I can carry it just fine, it gives me something to do on the bus.""       
So frankly I don't know whether this exchange escalated now or whether we had one more round of: 'nah, you should leave it home' and my 'really, i'll be fine, don't worry about it', but then my mom completely burst. She walked away quickly and, visibly angry, told me to give her the money back, because she doesn't need anybody arranging anything for her if it can't be done properly.        
Me: o.O wait what       
Mom: continues being super upset at this point, angrily walks around the apartment, on verge of tears. She keeps saying stuff like „what a bitch, what a cunt, what a mean girl, how come, how can she be so mean“ [(referring to me) - *ok, this might be intense for some, but I am used to a shower of cuss words that she keeps repeating to herself when upset. I think the sensitivity has been pretty much lowered for her – she needs it to cope, and when she calls out ‚cunt, bitch, cow‘, she’s not super evil about it; it might as well be like when somebody angrily says ‚what a fool‘*].        
Me: Well, noted, I should have probably shut the fuck up by this point for sure. But even for our standards ,this is a fight about a super non-serious topic, and I just keep hoping that I can rationalize our way out of it into calmness instead of just quickly agreeing about not taking the book with me, but this way still leaving my mom wounded about how nothing can ever go her way without a fight. So I calm down, approach her, and ask her: ‚Please, mom, I will definitely leave the book home, but just explain to me why it makes you so upset? How does it affect you, how I go about my way of doing this errand, if I can still get it done?“        
Mom, angrily, keeps arranging something and doesn’t look me in the eye: „Pack two. Three. Why not pack four kilos of books with you.“       
Me: „Common, please, we are being irrational. Tell me how you think it will affect you; I am sure we will find out it won’t.“       
Mom, angrily again: „I’m telling you, pack four. Pack four goddamn books with you.“ *walks over to the kitchen.*       
Me: „Please, I just want to understand, why are you so upset.“       
Mom: grabs a knife. Makes stabbing movements in the air and saying „it’s like stab, stab, stab, stabbing one over and over again, making the wound deeper and deeper, yeah, just keep asking that question over and over.“          
I realize all is lost. My mom is crying. She walks out of the room angrily. I am flabbergasted as hell.      
       
Five minutes in. Mom calmly walks in as if nothing happened, and starts talking to me about something else that I have to do tomorrow. I know the dance is over. There will be no apologies from either side, and it will never be talked again. All is good till the next dance.         
        
Guys, as I say, if I learned to 100% always always always shut up and follow virtually every sentence she says, all would be fine. My grandma who lives with her (mom takes care of her) tries, and some burst still happens multiple times a week. Are we bad at handling our mom, or does she have some kind of mental condition? You know, when she’s angry, she’s not just angry, **she is so…desperate,too**. I would give anything to limit those episodes; not just for my sake, for her, too. Any suggestions? Should I read some help book as to how to respond to these situations so I don't trigger her [I don't claim I'm never at fault either]; or do you think my mom has some kind of condition that could be dealt with?        
Thanks to any wonderful soul who read through all this. Have a lovely day.

I know happy to sad and vice versa happens but this goes beyond that, i am rarely content. I often go through bouts of rage as well. I feel this tightening in my stomach and everything pisses me off. This usually is paired with jealousy as well. I often think of hurting or even killing people or myself. This doesnt always happen in the rage though, i just think it sometimes. I have trouble discerning whats real, and i am constantly paranoid like everyone is talking about me or is out to get me. I have really bad anxiety that started when i was about 15. i cant really function in public places which is really inhibiting my social life. Also, lately ive been hearing bits and pieces of conversations and i have always seen things out of the corner of my eye. This is what really worries me as the the conversations are new and the visual hallucinations are much more frequent. i dont know where the line of ""normal"" and abnormal is anymore.

Anyway
I'm not sure where to start but let me just ramble 
I have realized that I talk to myself, interview myself, and often sit alone in silence, conversing with the second voice in my head, it resembles me, it picks out my mistakes , it has the same personality as me. It is me, but its not.
I'm not sure, 
I achieve generally of a high standard in school, but I'm not satisfied, I feel that I am not rewarded for my effort, why should I try, what does it matter? 
I feel like I deserve something, yet nothing.
But Im told I'm greedy by the voice when I think I deserve something, yet I still want it, but I feel guilty. As a result I work harder, achieve higher, but I'm still never rewarded, I don't feel I have achieved anything. I'm sad, I feel as though I've been greedy, yet not received anything , I don't know how to explain it.

Additionally , as im typing this, I'm being told, by the voice that some things I have typed are wrong, I'm being told to delete what I'm writing, and a lot of it I have, involuntarily.

Recently I acquired my probabtionary drivers license (I can drive on my own for the first time), just the Sunday passed I was leaving my girlfriends house (10:30 pm), I got in my car, I left my parking spot, and hit a car on my way out, causing some damage to it, little to mine.
The entire way home the voice was screaming at me, I was crying , screaming ""I have fucked up"" and during the entire drive I was physically fighting the voice which was telling me to pull a sharp right into oncommkng traffic, poles, trees or walls, the voice wanted me gone. 
I stopped at a petrol station and erupted in tears, I couldn't control myself. It wasn't me anymore.

The man behind the counter came outside and asked me if I was alright,  I couldn't respond, I became the voice inside my head, and what I wanted to say was yes, I just had a small accident, and I was whispering it in my mind, but instead I said no (invulantarily) , said yes don't worry I'll be fine, and pointed to the scuff on my car.

Tonight, I lay on my bed for what seems like 5 minutes, but was infact an hour, eyes wide open, falling deeper into my mind, talking with the voice.

There is something more I want to type, but I can't... I can't explain why.

I also have these weird thoughts, violent thoughts, it scares me, for example, I was rubbing my dog's stomach with my foot, and caught myself thinking ""I could just put my weight on this foot and kill you"", terrified, I immediately stopped and went to my room, I love animals, especially my dogs, it just popped into my head in graphic detail. There are other thoughts like this.

I don’t want to spend money on therapy.  I feel like it would be a waste to spend money fixing something I systematically broke myself. To spend a bunch of money trying to understand my mistakes seems too much of a defeat.  Plus I have no money.

I think I’ve given myself an eating disorder, even though I hate the label because I am wary of diagnosing myself and then allowing myself to sink deeper. If I told people I was struggling with food then I’d be watched all the time and everyone would suddenly be clued in and I’d never have the freedom to eat a sandwich or not eat a sandwich without having it analysed. I love my freedom and I want to do what I want without it being questioned. I don’t want to ruin a good time with friends by whining about my problems. I don’t want my boyfriend to respect me less. If he found out that I am obsessed with the goal of being thinner and that some days I eat too much and throw it up again wastefully because I am greedy and weak then he’d know I’m not a successful adult. I want to be fun and strong all the time and I’ve admitted my problems in the past to friends and I didn’t find it helpful at all. I felt like I’d sold out, and like I needn’t have brought it up because now I’ve gone and brought down the tone. I ended up wishing that I’d just enjoyed our time together as that would have been more therapeutic anyway that wallowing in self-made problems. 
I don’t even want to give up my goal of being thinner, so complaining about my eating attitude seems silly if I have no intention of trying to get better. If I was actively seeking recovery then it would make sense to tell the truth. But to tell someone what is going on when I don’t plan to stop doing it is just cruel for them. 

My personality is changing. I’m laid back and happy normally, but I’ve found myself snapping at my boyfriend on occasion. I apologise almost immediately afterwards and we even joke about it. I make fun of myself and try to make sure he knows that he didn’t do anything wrong. 

I have good friends and they all think I am very content. They have commented on my recent weight loss. I just say that it was a result of casually trying to be a bit healthier. But I don’t feel like I’m done. I had a goal, but every time I reach the goal I feel like I ought to be another 5 pounds less. 

I love life and adventures and I listen to science and philosophy lectures on things because I want to learn more things. I love climbing trees and talking to strangers. 
I feel like the best thing for me to do is not to dwell at all on the whole eating disorder business, I feel as though dwelling on it drags me in deeper. So I keep climbing trees and making friends and forgetting that there is any problem.  I don’t want to wallow in self pity because there seems to be no logical reason for me to do so. 

But I do feel quite lonely. I'm sad sometimes, and I will say sometimes to my boyfriend that I feel sad, and he'll ask why, and I don't know what to say, so I'll say ""I just do a bit."" and then cheer up 5 minutes later and say I was having a silly moment. I am too frightened to tell anybody, I don’t want to ruin the image I’ve built up. I don’t want to dangle my problems in front of people only to tell them that there’s no way to fix them. So I don’t have anyone to talk to. 

I’m sorry, I don’t know how to phrase this as a question. But any comments are welcome, I need new perspectives. I’ve been inside my own head so much that I might have a warped view.

I'd say I had what I would call my first breakdown when I was 16 years old.  I honestly can't pinpoint what caused it, but it began after returning from a summer volunteer service trip to a third world country.  The results were pretty devastating for me socially and emotionally.  I pushed away my friends and girls who were interested in me, failed my driving test, and did terribly in school.  It took a year to get back on my feet.

I had my second one about 3 and a half years later, shortly before I turned 20.  My first serious girlfriend, who I'd been with since I'd gotten over my previous issues, dumped me for my best friend at the time.  Around this time my other best friend returned from Afghanistan, and I discovered he was a shell of the person I once knew.  Many more simply drifted away, and my social circle grew smaller and smaller.  Despite being on scholarship, I transferred from a party school to a tech school closer to home.  I managed to befriend nobody there, probably because I viewed them all as too nerdy and they viewed me as too miserable.  I stayed up all night and slept during the day, skipping virtually all of my classes.  I was convinced to meet with several therapists, who cycled me through various anti-depressants and SSRIs which did nothing but make things far worse for the agonizing few months I was on them.  My family were really the only ones who recognized that I was circling the drain and made some effort to help me, letting me stay at home on weekends and even taking me on a trip.  At the end of the trip (which was a drunken blur) I hit rock bottom.  I dropped out school, and pathetically stayed in my room for several weeks and did nothing but sleep, cry, and gain weight.

This second breakdown took much longer to undo, but after a couple years I began turning my life around.  I got a real job and went to community college.  I've been accepted to a university far better than either of the two I previously studied at and will be transferring there after I finish my summer classes.  I exercise virtually every day and am in the best shape of my life.  I've been seeing a girl these past few months and we've been keeping it light and fun.  

Now I'm 23 years old, and probably overdue for another.  On the surface everything seems fine, but somehow I still feel as though I'm being drawn towards the brink, and some things are pushing me there a little bit faster.  A foot injury while running a half marathon a couple months ago that is only now finally starting to heal.  Being diagnosed with severe hypertension at an absurdly young age, practically guaranteeing me an early death of something awful like a stroke.  A girlfriend who won't stop abusing her medication and has overdosed several times since I met her.  A kid brother who's lost most of the use of his right arm after a cycling accident.  A sister who is completely psychotic and abusive to everyone she interacts with (family history of mental illness it seems).  The daily stress of having to drive to one side of the state for classes in the morning and then work in the afternoon on the other side.  The looming prospect of massive debt from the student loans I'll have to take out at this new university.  I just took a week of vacation to unwind, but I don't really feel unwound.  I spent most of it by myself.  I consider myself somewhat attractive and informed about the world but also have severe social anxiety, tricking others into believing that I'm a fun and interesting person is exhausting and can only be done for short amounts of time.

Since the last time I had a breakdown I haven't really made any friends, aside from my brother and girlfriend (who I try not to smother with attention) I'm left with two that I hang out with every few weeks.  The only other people I ever really interact with are my coworkers, my parents, and their dogs. Most of my interactions with people are friendly, but shallow.   Most nights I come home alone, trapped with my own thoughts.  Video games, television, my hobbies, and the internet have distracted me well enough but they are starting to get very, very boring and repetitive by this point.  A lot of nights I find myself smoking weed just to chill the fuck out and not spend too much time obsessing over my shortcomings, and I fear if it weren't for that I would have already snapped months ago.

These past few years I've been simply too busy to worry about my lack of deep, meaningful relationships with other people and how few people actually give a shit about me or would miss me if I was gone, but for some reason or another it's starting to get to me now.  It's the only thing in the world that I want right now but, despite my countless attempts to get out and do something about it.

My mental state is completely compromising my job, and overall life. At 31 I feel like my mental health is slipping away as I get older. I know this sounds pathetic, but I literally need to ease into seeing a psych doc by communicating over the internet before seeing one in person. There is something in me holding me back from making that jump to see one. This same thing holding me back is affecting most of my life. I ignore bills (have terrible credit) go to work much later in the day than I should (if I go in at all) and always keep my phone on do not disturb mode because of the potential of getting a call or text I don't want to see/hear. I am completely incapable of focusing myself to overcome it and feel it has taken control. I could get up every morning at 5 AM with every intention of getting to work by 9, but will stop myself and simply not do it, and show up at like 2pm. I feel like I can't initialize anything anymore and my brain is unable to understand the consequences of what I am doing, but also does understand at the same time. The part of me that chooses to ignore the consequences has completely taken over. 

Example:

Boss tells me to get my admin work done because I am months behind. I tell him that I am on top of it. I go turn on my laptop, connect to VPN, open my database, and then walk away and do something else (video games, TV, internet, or simply getting lost in some fantasy in my head) because I simply can't bring myself to actually do it. The next week boss see I still haven't done it, and is he twice as mad, and this cycle continues until the pressure is high enough that I do just enough to get him off my back. I cause so much anxiety for myself but there is like a feedback failure to associate getting things done with preventing anxiety. I know it sounds like I am just lazy, and perhaps I am, but I need something to change because this conflict in my brain, this self limiting mechanism is destroying my life. I will actively avoid anything that causes discomfort, and only cause more problems. I have always procrastinated, always had issues with being late to work/school, have always been very awkward, disorganized, and had low confidence, but it hasn't tapered off with age, and seems to be getting significantly worse.

As a child I was both already introverted by personality, isolated, and abused. I've been working hard to settle my issues and be self-aware. I made a lot of progress, but I'm not sure on this area... grief.

Over the last 6 years, I've faced major losses. A relative and a long-time friend violently committed suicide. Another friend died due to a terminal illness. Two more friends I was beginning to become close to moved far and lost contact. My mother negligently killed two pets I was close to. I never had much to do with friendship, so whenever someone I liked out of that small circle died or left, I used to feel devastated.

However, after the death of friend to terminal illness years ago, I felt nothing for two recent deaths after that or the friends moving away. I was sad that I didn't feel sad about them, if that makes any sense. Hearing the news, thinking about them didn't make me grieve or feel anything.

I really loved one pet, I rescued it, raised it, and let my family take care of it when I was busy with studies. For one whole week, they did not give him water or food. I didn't know until I came to check on him, they told me, ""Wow, I can't believe he's still alive, he hasn't had water all week! Haha!"" My pet died the day after that. When I was a kid they killed my other pet in the same way: they left him without water. I only felt angry and hopeless that I let the same thing happen again, that my trust was betrayed, I shouldn't have left my pets with them, etc. I still didn't feel sad about my little guy dying, just the person involved. I didn't feel like I missed him after he was gone.

Just recently another friend died of terminal illness suddenly. Everyone is crying and shocked about it, I felt surprised when I heard it because I thought it was someone I had just been talking to, afterward I didn't feel anything. I feel uncomfortable telling others who were close to that friend the news, but I don't feel sad about the death or the funeral. I feel awkward around these people who are mourning and crying. What's up? Can I re-learn empathy or am I screwed because of how I was raised or was I born with my parents' disorder?

Sorry for the wall of text, but I need to get this out. 

I've been struggling my entire 24 years of life with something I could never put my finger on and label. I can't officially say if it's AvPD at this point, but i'm going to see someone about this very soon. 

Basically, i'm extremely self critical, to the point where I truly, wholeheartedly believe I am mentally challenged. This means I haven't worked in years, in fact, I have barely left the house in so long i've grown even more afraid of the ""real world"". Even taking a walk is a big deal for me. 
What supports my claim of being ""retarded"" is very simple: The only i've ever been proficient at is... failure. Ever since I can remember, i've been incompetent, unfocused and slow. From learning to ride a bike, to getting behind the wheel of a car. All stress, misery and clumsiness. Every job i've ever had, i've been fired from. Why, you ask? Well, not because I was always late or because I acted like a douche. No, it's because I sucked. 

I've had friends, and still (somewhat) do, although since i've been in hermit mode for the past 5-6 years, we only talk on Facebook. I can't say we've ever been close, although they might say we have. I'm really not sure. I've always had trouble truly connecting with them, not because I don't care for them or love them, but because i'm unable to relax and just be myself. Always shy, reserved, fearful and a hermit. I can't open up, or just be ""one of the guys"". I'm too afraid of being judged or hurt in someway. Same thing sexually. I can't, not because I ""can't"", but because i'm unable to focus. I hate being in my skin. I know i've been made fun of for it behind my back, and the thought of it sort of bothers me to this day. Somedays it drives me crazy. 

The only thing i'm alright at is music. People tell me they like my work, strangers I mean. They send me messages and stuff, which is fun to hear and makes me feel good and worthy, but then again, being an ""artist"" isn't a job. Even if it was a possibility, how in the world could I succeed, when I can't interact with people? How could I do shows and perform when taking a walk is like a trip to the moon for me?

I'm still living with my parents, and I will have to move out soon. I want to be independent, but I have nothing. No skills, no diploma, no future, no intelligence... no hope. Suicide has been on my mind A LOT lately. It seems like a beautiful thing, just letting go. The world seems so dark and grey, and working minimum wage in a shitty factory to scrape by on pennies, only to go sleep in a small dusty apartment for the rest of my days is not what I want. Sadly, it's all I can achieve. 

I'm not looking for sympathy, I just need to speak with people who can understand. 

Thank you.

This is my first time posting here, I hope you can bare with me. 
I´ve had this feeling for around 2 years. When I look in the mirror it is like i´m looking at a `different´ person, not somebody I feel connected with. Maybe it is a regular occurance, maybe not. However there are some thing I need to tell.
I´m 18 years old and currently living with my dad. My dad has been an alcoholist for a long time (16 years).  My parents divorced around a year ago, and I regualary see my siblings/mother. 

I've been smoking weed for half a year almost every day, because I like the feeling it gives me. It makes me feel different then when I normally am. I feel like i'm chasing the feeling to be different, to be high all the time so that I won't feel sober. 

I realize this is problematic and want to change, but somehow I just can't. I keep making excuses like: Oh I won't get any weed tomorrow, i'm fine. Even though I KNOW i'm buying weed the next day to ""make it through the evening"". This has caused me some financial problems. My dad knows that I smoke weed, and approves of it since he thinks (I do aswell) that regular use of weed is better then regular use of alcohol. I've been to a psychiatrist (for a ADD diagnosis) to talk about my problems, but since my parents were there I couldn't tell the psychiartist everthing. 

I'm worried that things will get out of hand.
Can someone tell me what's wrong with me? 

Like I said it's like  I don't recognize myself anymore.

Nonetheless, it would suffice to say that for reasons that are beyond my specific situation or particular place in life I have been going through brief periods of elation and infinite motivation, followed by massive depression and the desire to kill myself. It is very much strange just as well because when each separate period comes about, the same things run through my head such as how and why I ever felt that way.

I'm 16 and basically over the past 3 years I've known I'm not 'normal' mental health wise. I'm just unsure on how to categorize what I have because I really don't like the idea of going to a doctor because I just can't talk about my feelings like that. It's not something I can do face to face. From looking up and past counselling, I'm pretty sure I used to suffer from depression but I'm not that depressed anymore, this has improved a lot over the past year. I think I also have social anxiety, from reading symptoms and my experiences/how I feel in general. I just don't know because it's not like I can confirm it myself and I really don't want to talk about my feelings to someone.

I'd just like to say I don't think I suffer from it terribly because I think I've improved from how bad I used to be but I know I'm still not 'normal'. I mainly improved on my own (the counselling was more talking about it, it wasn't for long and I just changed my outlook mostly myself).

Anyway, I'd like to know if there's anywhere I can compare my experiences/feelings or send someone a message where I can fully explain how I feel because I find it a lot easier on the internet. I don't know sometimes I just feel as if I have so many problems in my head I'd just like to confirm it upfront or something because my head is so jumbled.

Right now he is in a mental health facility of some sort. It's been difficult to get any info out of his family about his diagnosis, treatment, or expected release.

    I'm looking for some advice on dealing with the grief of the loss of this relationship under these traumatic circumstances. Some details: -In the beginning he was a totally different person, after this manic episode I don't even know him. -I thought I was going to have a family with this person. We shared finances and we were to move in together within the next month. -I've gone into some financial turmoil because I supported him while he struggled. -Not to mention the horrible verbal and emotional abuse I experienced during the manic episode. He also told lies about me to all of his friends and family. -I'm definitely experiencing the stages of loss. Just so sad and tired right now.

    Additionally, I need advice on what to do about the puppy we rescued. Some details: -We rescued her and I provided much of the money and care for the puppy during the relationship. -He took her, and basically passed her off on friends during his manic episode. -When he was taken into police custody, he gave her to a stranger to...care for I guess. I think he really just didn't want me to have her. -I went and got the puppy from the stranger. -I received a shitty reply from his mother when I asked for an update about him; She accused me of trying to ""keep"" the puppy and that I knew that it would hurt him. I told her that I'd be happy to return the puppy when he is READY to take care of her. A lot of people simply don't understand ""furever home"" ideology. -I still don't know when he will get out or what he will do when he finds out I have the puppy. Plus, then there's the grieving process for when he takes her from me again.

I'm feeling a lot of despair right now. I don't want to resort to substances to numb my feelings, but I've been using weed, xanax, and alcohol over the past week or so. I don't really have money to eat, but I am planning on reaching out to my support system for that. I also want to seek counseling and am exercising often.

TL;DR Ex is currently in psych ward, don't know when he will be released or how he will react if he finds out I have the puppy of that I had a hand in his involuntary custody. Also don't know what to do about the puppy we rescued. Help me, I'm grieving hard and I'm scared.

She didn't prescribe any medications for my depression but we did talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy which helped somewhat. My depression was triggered by the fact that I really don't like my college: it's about 1000 miles away from home, the weather sucks, the quarter system is unnecessarily stressful with a difficult science major, I miss my friends from home constantly, and I don't particularly like the city/geographic region the school is in, are among my biggest issues. I do have friends that I love spending time with which always makes my mood better, but whenever I'm alone the loneliness and sadness come back.
I considered transferring but I really fucked up my grades the first quarter of freshman year, so I couldn't transfer for sophomore year. I decided not to transfer for junior year because I didn't want to start out at a new school where I didn't know anyone, and I'm embarrassed to say the fact that my school is ranked in the top 15 nationally and is considered very prestigious/elite was my main reason for staying.
I justified it to myself that 2 more years at this place were worth it for the benefits I would get graduating from such a highly ranked institution. But now summer break is almost over, and the idea that I have to go back for 2 more years is crushing me. My depression and anxiety had gone away during the summer because I got to go home and spend time with my friends and family, but now the depression and anxiety are back. I'm sad and feel like crying all the time and I usually feel panicky and nervous as well.

bloom2,,,1406514606,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2bwqk6/i_have_memories_that_arent_mine/,2bwqk6,True,3,False,1441247763,5,"Hello! I am an 18 year old female. I have not been diagnosed with any mental disorders nor is there any history of it in my family (as far as I know - mental illness is a bit of a taboo with my parents). I do regularly get symptoms of anxiety and paranoia but overall, I lead a fairly healthy and happy life. I am not very spiritual although I do have quite an imaginative mind, but I always know how to distinguish reality and fantasy. I have never taken hallucinogenic drugs and have only smoked marijuana socially about ten times in my life. 

Let me preface by admitting that I am no expert at how memories are formed or organized. However, like I mentioned before, I am very confident in my ability to know that a certain memory was just a dream/wild imagination as opposed to something that actually happened. I don't know how to concisely word this, but when I am remembering something that happened, no matter how faint that memory is, I retain a sense of context and awareness of exactly what was going on at that time. 

For example, if my mind briefly flashes over to a birthday party I went to when I was 7, I may only remember bits of it but I am aware that at that time, I was living in New York in 2003, my parents and my brother were all present at that point in time and I recognize that past me is the same person as present me. These all seem like pretty obvious observations but what I want to emphasize is that we all maintain a sort of mental subtext to every single memory that allows us to identify them and the surrounding context of those memories. 

The problem now is that I also get a third type of memory (the first being false memories that are more akin to dreams/daydreaming/imagination and the second being concrete memories of things that actually happened in my life). I've had these types of memories for as far as I can remember, but only recently have I begun to realize how abnormal they are, whereas when I was younger I just carelessly grouped it into the ""unexplained"" compartment of my brain. 

The third type of memory is generally way more brief and sporadic than the other two. They occur about once a week with no warning or any sort of ""trigger"". They are usually fast snapshots of completely normal things like a picnic by the lake, an autumn day, running down the stairs as a child in a country home, etc. The strange thing is I know they're not just made up memories or me remembering an old dream - of course, there is no scientific way to prove this other than by claiming that I know myself well enough to know that these things actually happened and I was there. However, the ""awareness"" that I explained earlier is completely foreign. Each of those memories I have come with its own context that has nothing to do with my current life - I ""know"" that I experienced them in the 80's or the 20's or the 50's, that I had been living in London for years or had just moved to my new house in France, that I was hanging out with my sisters that day (I don't have sisters), or even at certain points I sense that I was a boy. I know that my current family (my parents and my brother) weren't present in any of those memories, nor were any of my current friends and acquaintances. The familiarity and intimacy of all these random memories I have is incredibly profound but worrying, because I know that I never experienced those things in my current life. 

This may all seem very absurd, and trust me, I'm a huge skeptic of things like ""past life"" or you know, channeling memories of lost souls and things within those realms. However, that almost seems like the only ""reasonable"" explanation for all these memories. They are not mine, yet they are completely real. It is frustrating because things like memory cannot be measured or quantified as easily as other things in this world. I have considered seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist but I do not think they will take me seriously. Generally, these memories do not bother me and are usually very normal memories - nothing disturbing or shocking. I have had these ever since I could remember and I have made my peace with it. However, I do hate unresolved explanations as I'm very much a fact and scientific confirmation type of person. 

I would be grateful for any kind of guidance or support to help explain what is happening in my mind. I would like to resolve this once and for all. If you have experienced anything similar to this, please feel free to share! 

If you believe that this post was made in the wrong sub, please direct me to the right one.

**tl;dr: I have had memories that clearly aren't mine ever since I can remember. They are not false memories (ie. dreams or figments of imagination) and I know that I was there when I experienced this memory. Can someone help explain this?**

Anyway, I need help with my younger brother. He's 20. My parents separated when I was 14 and he was 12. They finalized their divorce barely a year ago. It was a long, drawn out mess, and my brother took it the hardest.

He was always a good kid. Very popular and also very smart. However, recently he has been acting very strange and I don't know how to help him anymore. The past few years have been severe ups and downs.

 He has gone months without coming out of his room. I would see him maybe once or twice when he would get up to use the bathroom or shower. When he would leave his room it would smell like someone died in there, due to a combination of food being left in there for weeks and because he would not shower for days on end. He also dropped out of school the first time this happened.

After a few months of seclusion he would become almost hyperactive. He would do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING he could. Rearrange his room, go on shopping sprees, hang out with his friends again, pick up hobbies. wWhatever he could do, he was doing it. He would also change the hobbies he would pick up SUPER fast. Like one week it would be rock climbing, the next week he would be into making electronic music. Nothing stuck. 

As time went on he went back into not taking to anyone. He would go back to saying in his room all day, he would talk about how he didn't want to live anymore and how he messed up his life. He would tell me all his friends were graduating, or getting good jobs and he couldn't even hold one. I coaxed him back into school but still he became fixated on getting straight A's and would cry himself to sleep if he got anything less than that. He dropped out after one quarter, again.

Recently, he has come out of his ""reclusion"", and has randomly said he is going to move away to work for his dream company for free and is leaving in a few months. Just a few days before he broke the news to us, he wouldn't even talk to anyone. He's too old for us to stop him, but I am so worried that he's not okay. I can't force him to get help, but I have been watching him go through serious highs and lows and I can't help but think he may have some mental hurdles to sort out. He has also picked up this ""I'm better than you"" attitude where he dismisses anyone who doesn't support his move and asks him to really think about what he is doing. He's told our mom that he doesn't want anything to do with her, and calls our father an ""investor"" instead of his dad. 

I just want to make sure he is okay and that he doesn't get hurt. We have a history of depression and people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder in our family.

these tend to be undoubtedly influenced by various triggers, usually visual ... then hormones become affected, this in turn as it were turns up the heat on these sexual thoughts to where they torment me... at times I get some relief by fapping from the sexual thoughts, but that simply becomes a vicious cycle. as the body now replenishes itself, and in short time even without visual, aural or other triggers, often a trigger might be a thought itself that triggers the release of powerful hormones.

This is quite different than the usual thoughts that are much easier to manage, those are painful enough, but the sexual thoughts and the defeat that follows giving into them, just dwelling on them, or fapping is terrible

Can anyone elaborate/give me their own personal take?

Personally, this sounds poorly worded. On the one hand, I understand that you can be happy without needing anything to ""happen"" (buddhism and mindfulness helped me understand this fact), but to say as the author does that happiness *cant* come from events in your life sounds nonsensical--in my mind, it's equivalent to saying sadness can't occur because of events in your life (death of a family member, etc).

I understand that happiness/sadness occur due to your perspective on events in your life, and that your perspective can be tweaked, but certain things are hard/impossible/undesirable to tweak (again, such as a family member's passing). At the least, I'd say the author poorly worded things, no?

Also, I'm not sure if this is mentioned later in the book, but is it important to catch each and every negative thought and analyze it with CBT techniques? I've reduced it to doing one negative thought per day (it was tedious before).

To start things out, I've never actually suffered from depression. I was put on a 20 mg dose of Celexa to combat anxiety when I was 8 years old. I took Celexa for roughly 9 years (Age 8 to Age 17) and I recently stopped taking the medication. I did not stop cold turkey, but I tapered off at a rather fast rate (10 mg for one week, 5 for one week, then none). The withdrawal effects were not immediate, but I quickly became more irritable and had increasingly stressful thoughts. A couple nights ago I had what I believe was a panic attack due to stress brought on by whether to quit my job or not before school started. Ever since then, I began to first feel stressed, which then grew into depression along with anxiety which have stuck with me for about 2 days now. I want to believe these are brought on by withdrawal effects of Celexa, but I am sometimes having doubts. For anyone else who has come off of antidepressants, are these symptoms typical? and how long do they last?

EDIT: I'd also like to add that I came off the Celexa because I felt that it had done its job and had no real effect on me, and hadn't for a very long time, so I have no plans of going back on any antidepressants ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Experiencing antidepressant withdrawal symptoms

So, I will likely cross post this to some other sub-reddit at some point, but I wanted to see what other readers (maybe students?) had any suggestions for me in regards to how you guys all keep your stress under control. 

Of course I know some (okay, a lot) of stress is pretty inevitable in a college environment. However, I feel like I don't know how to handle stress properly. At the beginning of college, I really wasn't like this at all. But ever since some circumstances have changed for me and I've had more responsibilities besides school ever since the beginning of this school year, the stress and anxiety eats me up at times!

 Personally, I have some very perfectionist and work-a-holic tenancies that's begun to interfere a bit in my general (mostly physical) well being. For example, sometimes I just feel plain guilty when I'm not either studying or working. Or I find myself being really upset over something like a grade. I know logically that people *need* breaks &amp; to socialize and that sure, getting an A is nice but at the end of the day, not *that* important...but my scumbag brain just won't let me get a rest. 

 I've talked with a psychologist at school about this and we've worked out certain viable solutions that I've been trying that's been helpful like meditating and sleep hygiene. Thus far I've cut my work hours, started working out, and I will make a VERY conscious effort to have fun instead of freaking out over a damn reading. 

I guess I just wanted to ask how for any tips on a) how to be even better at taking off the stress b) how to stop having these ""perfectionist"" tendencies

So, as of late, I've had an extreme lack of motivation.. I literally don't want to do anything. I've been bound to my couch except for when I'm at work, and honestly, it's where I want to be. This is frustrating because I'm graduating with my bachelors in the fall and this past summer semester was a genuine struggle. I barely passed one class and ended up dropping another. It's not that these classes were difficult or anything either.. It came down to me sitting on my couch deciding that I don't want to go. 
In addition to the school problems, even the simplest of tasks I cannot complete. I haven't been grocery shopping in over two months. I rely on restaurants that will deliver and my girlfriend to cook for me. I know how to cook, but I just have no desire to.. I literally sit around hungry. Also, I don't want to go anywhere... I do almost all of my shopping because it comes right to my door. When I'm asked to go to the store, run an errand, do anything, I never want to. And when I do, say go to the post office, it is absolutely draining... I'm not really sure why I've been having these feelings, but it is honestly troubling. I need to be on task and I have so many things I need to do, but I simply don't and just barely get by with school, work, living. The part I like even less is that once school is back in session I'm going to be taking adderall nearly every day just so I can be focused enough and motivated enough to get anything done. 
In conclusion, I have always had a bit of social anxiety, but now I'm not sure what it is, but I don't like it, and I can't live and be successful this way. 
I appreciate anyone's advice or opinion. Also, this was done on my phone so excuse any typos and grammar errors..

I know you're not supposed to get people on the internet to diagnose you but hopefully I could at least get some advice from someone with a background in mental health disorders. Ok so here goes:

I'm a 19 year old female studying to be a nurse. I go to college in Dublin, Ireland and still live at home with my family. I have great friends and a pretty good life tbh, which makes this even more confusing. I have been depressed before at the ages of 12- when I was being bullied and at 15- when I really freaking hated my school. These were never officially diagnosed but looking back I knew I was. Both these times I got better by moving school.

Thing is my life is pretty much good right now. I really like what I do in college and can't really pin point why I am feeling the way I am feeling.

Ever since January I've kind of been having ups and downs. First it was just a consistent down slope. At first I thought it was just a post-christmas back to college slump but I still felt like shit after my 19th in Feb. Then I just started crying everyday, thinking my life would never work out for the best and that I'd never be happy. I just kept thinking about what the fucking point was. This also amplified some symptoms which I had been having for years- which I just thought were you know, me. 

I have had a crap attention span since I was a kid, but I started daydreaming more and living my life through my little fantasies in my head, it became increasingly difficult to have conversations with people, it was like I could't focus properly on what they were saying and I would just daze off when they were in the middle of their sentence, and I would interrupt people when I was having a good conversation not because I was being rude (I know its so fucking rude and I constantly try to stop myself but sometimes I just can't hold it in) but because I was really excited about what I had to say.

Around halfway through March, I got a boost back. I started feeling great! I would go on spontaneous shopping trips with money I really shouldn't have been spending and just generally feeling great about life. I couldn't understand why I had been feeling the way. This quickly went away, the depression came back, worse this time. My voice became monotone nearly and I would drag my feet and move slowly around the house, somehow I still went to college everyday but I became lazy with my appearance, just throwing on whatever I could find rather that doing my hair and make up and having a cute outfit set out. 

Some nights I would curl up in bed in the fetal position with my hands in my hair sobbing because my mind would be racing but almost like a slow racing???? It was so confusing. Also my eyes never focused properly, it felt like the world was just dull. 

I decided it was too much and went to the college doctor. He put it down to depression and anxiety but then when I told him about the fast talking, concentration span, daydreams, he gave me this questionaire and I filled it out. Afterwards he asked if I had been like this for a few years or so and I was like ""I've been like this all my life???"". Turns out I might have ADHD, which is really underdiagnosed in girls and is more commonly diagnosed at my age since girls don't tend to act out with ADHD.

So I had all these diagnosises and was put in therapy and on 10mg of citalopram. This is the beginning of May now. The citalopram made me feel really nauseous for over 3 weeks, and I hadn't realised it myself but I had been feeling slightly better, I recognised this once I stopped taking them. 

I hated therapy and my doctor. They kept trying to shove things down my throat. They kept trying to pin point areas about why I was depressed when I didn't even know myself. So after I was told to stop taking the citalopram due to the side effects. I stopped going because they were stressing me out so much.

June was a hellish month for me. Because the citalopram made me feel nauseous all the time I developed an anxiety for feeling that way. Everytime I left the house I would feel nauseous from the anxiety that I would puke. Which made the anxiety worse. Which made the nausea worse. Never ending cycle. It has seriously put a huge damper on my life.

And then at the beginning of July I started to feel good again, feeling a bit hyper but I will have the odd few days where everything is normal, and then I have days where I don't see the point in anything and just cry.

I feel so confused and I feel like I'm going crazy. I didn't find the doctors helpful at all and I don't know if I actually have ADHD or depression or anxiety or anything. 

Please can someone help me :(",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Don't know what's wrong with me- would like some advice

I've had some suicide attempts as well as regular self-harm, but I've been working through and out of that for a couple years now. Right now, i'm fairly stable with a good therapist and a SO relationship that's finally moving from toxic-as-fuck to vaguely-normal. It's been hard work, and I've done a shit-ton of it, but I'm finally, at 30, moving upward and onward. So that's where I am.

So one of my close friends from high school suffers from a variety of pretty debilitating mental illnesses - not like just anxiety, but some real fucking shit. He's very smart, very articulate, and very, very much in pain.  He's also very much ""in his head"" - intellectual, brainy, etc. He's suicidal most of the time, and reaches out in severely toxic ways. I now live out of town, but we text and he is brutal in texts. He threatens to kill himself regularly, rips apart the meaning of the world, sends VERY dramatic texts regularly and then becomes self-indulgently melodramatic about how miserable the state of humanity it.

I'm exhausted, guys.

I try to be present without trying to ""fix"" him, but he also actively tries to bait me - he knows I'm deeply religious, and he regularly tells me that prayer is meaningless and I'm wasting my life. I know this isn't personal (my master's degree is in a psychology/mental health related field, I'm not a dumbass) and I know he's just needy and grabbing for help however he can, but how can I be present with him without being pulled into a whirlpool of this awfulness? 

I know that some of our teachers have tried to get him set up with help/jobs/living situations, and he is in and out of therapy and in-patient facilities, but he always quits on everything because he thinks he's the special percentage of the world that can't be fixed (he specifically said that to me at one point). 

I want to feel pity and empathy for him, because I know what it's like to be so trapped inside your brain. But he reaches out in such toxic ways and I want to let him know how harmful he is being (oh, also, he makes incredibly passive aggressive Facebook posts regularly, often being very over-the-top about his emotions, or talking about people who don't listen to him or aren't in his life anymore because they're ""selfish"")

My career is working with mental illness. I'm not naive. But honestly I am exhausted and don't know what my role should be for him, as a friend. He doesn't have a lot of friends left (shockingly). Should I call him out on it? How do you tell someone with severe mental illness to ""stop being dramatic"" - it's like telling someone onboard the sinking Titanic to stop being dramatic. I mean, I've been there - I've reached out for help in emotionally violent ways that have driven people away. I'm not judging him, but - how do I express that he's harming his chances of being cared for in the ways that he expresses his needs?

This was really helpful to type up for me, actually. Mostly I'm just really tired. I don't want to quit on him. But he's pretty overwhelming. :-/ Any suggestions?",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Mentally ill myself, dealing with severely mentally ill friend - mostly a vent, also advice needed"

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. Even as a child I was severely anxious it was only as I got into my adult years that I found myself to also be depressed. I know they go hand in hand. 

I have been off work for 6 months under the direction of my doctor after having a mental breakdown in March. Since then I have visited many doctors, social workers, yogis, you name it. 

On Tuesday I had an appointment with a psychotherapist for a consult to join one of his mindfulness workshops to help me deal with my anxiety going forward. 

He laid a bomb on me. He claims that from what I told him he feels that even though I say I had a great childhood, privileged, perfect even- he feels that I actually had a very difficult childhood with parents who have unfortunately created a lot of long term mental damage for me. He went on to say that he feels that without Psychotherapy weekly for the next 3-5 years that I will continue to end up in the situation I am in repeatedly. 

I do not feel that he has suggested this for his own monetary gain because 1. I live in a country where this service is paid for by the government and 2. He is booked for the next 3 years. 

I guess I'm not sure what I'm asking- does anyone have experience with this type of therapy? I know that I need help to overcome this black cloud that has been bubbling up for many years.

Let me sum some things up for you before I start this post;
I am fifteen years of age.
Despite my absence of a father, I have been brought up in what would be deemed a ""average"" childhood, with a predominantly middle class family. 
I aspire a career in the military, as a officer preferably.
I dedicate allot of time to fitness, I have a strict schedule for all my fitness routine, I tend to schedule many things - it just makes stuff simpler.

So, that should give you a very basic perception on the type of individual I am, though I do not think any human should be judged by a mere three sentences, but anywho.

Lately is has daunt on me I may be a psychopath, or maybe just a very deluded teenager. I am a very assertive person, some would describe me as loud, and opinionated others as intelligent and thoughtful, that all depends on what persona I have decided to adapt to in that particular circumstance. Though right now I am in what I like to call, my natural mode - no persona, no characteristics. I had never thought as myself as a psychopath, just that I was a little different then my peers and others around me. Within a certain class at school, we are a very talkative bunch and we express our opinions on the topics of which we are learning, this is history by the way. One day, my teacher wanted me to take some mediocre online psychopath test to which I scored 86 percent. Since then I have looked more into the whole idea that I may actually be a psychopath. When I came to review where I may fit into these traits into recent situations it does sort of make sense, allow me to post some scenarios and I will allow you to judge;

I act. I adapt to persona depending on circumstances and I watch the others around me and how they react to the character I am playing, this allows me to get a full grasp on the individual and lets me play mind games with them. I do this on a daily basis.

I have never actually, loved someone. I admire three people dearly, my mother, my little brother and my nana (grandmother). Though despite these three people I don't really ""love"" anyone else. I have had relationships with girls, but most of the time I just fake ""loving"" them.

I don't really feel empathy for people, and often get confused when people are really upset or on the contrary. For example, last year X (No names) died, my step father's brother (A). A found X dead on his toilet, X was a alcoholic druggie to be frank. A came in my room, crying and screaming, and told me about X. A then went downstairs to make some phone calls, to which I finished my pizza then went downstairs to offer help to A. I understand it was his brother, but still he should have known it was coming due to X's substance abuse.

I don't really feel connected with anyone. No matter how hard I try, I feel isolated and like no one can relate to me. I am not to fussed about this, I like spending time by myself and being alone, though sometimes I am curious to know what it is like to be love someone, or have strong feelings for someone. 

I enjoy the thrill of life. Being pushed to my physical limitations, attempting things others fear.

I understand those who read this will assume I am dick. Let me note that what I am writing is not shared with those associated with me in real life. I know how to show empathy, and how to provide support for those who may be upset and so fourth, I have observed people doing it my whole life I would be pretty idiotic not to pick up on it. I just needed to get some outsiders view on my situation, rather than have it all inside me. 

Any questions are welcomed, and any posts in regards to what I should do about this whole situation is also welcomed.

Also to add before I get the typical ; ""Do you have the urge to kill"" questions. As previously said, I aspire a career in the military. That should be clear if it came to kill or be killed I would not hesitate in eliminating the target in question, but I wouldn't just go and kill anyone I don't feel the urge for that, not one bit. But I am not phased by death, seeing violent things or participating in violent situations if anything it is exciting.

2) Falling in love with another man. Also not unusual. Except he's half her age, has a child with a woman he already loves, and her attentions have caused him to block her on Facebook and worry for the safety of his family. She thinks he's going to come and sweep her off her feet any day now.


3) She briefly thought she had laser vision, and would not open her eyes until she was brought reflective sunglasses.


4) She'll spend hours in her room doing weird stuff like staring into a mirror for hours, believing she can send and receive messages with people. Also. She won't let anyone in her room ever.


5) Satan is after her.


There's really a lot more I could mention about this story, but my mind is rather stressed, and I don't want to write a novel. Basically, she needs help. However, she refuses any suggestion to that effect and gets angry. She's left the state to go stay in a city she thinks her ""lover"" will know to come get her. The hotel is about to kick her out for weird behavior. My aunt is willing to let her stay with her. My mom does not want to stay with her, and I'm guessing it has to do with not wanting to miss her man if he comes to take her away. 


What I'm asking is... Is there anything I can do? She's not violent or self-harming, so we can't make her get help. She's in a tailspin, and I'm so lost. This was not how she was when I was young. She was sweet and wonderful. She still seems normal when me and my brothers talk to her (we're not supposed to know about all the weird stuff she's been doing). 


What do I do? How do I convince her she needs to get help?

Is this conclusion justified or would you consider it a result of paranoid-thinking? I will not be insulted if you believe it was the result of paranoid thinking, as I genuinely want honest answers.

I had cancer when i was younger and was sexual abused twice when i turned 17, i started writing non stop at that age, constantly taking notes - having so many ideas, writing down every thought all while feeling like life is a long daydream and i feel like im sexually available to anyone/everything which is scary. i started to have graphic intrusive imagery (incest, homicide, murder, violence) and the writing spiraled out of control, i have over 300k words worth of notes but they are all fragmented and I look at them like ""What is that?"" My mind is always on creative overdrive, anytime someone talks or if I read something - it can trigger a new image or form full dialogue... for this reason I avoid mostly all music/movies/literature. I can not read books. Even my external stimuli, exhausts me. The doctors say it is PTSD/pure ocd/major depression and general anxiety but I don't know if that really makes sense. I create dialogue and imagery out of poems I write in blackout moments. I never grew up reading literature but I finished a manuscript and have been in talks with a few literary agents and publishers... I always noting details of imagery, I can barely handle a text messaging conversation without using it as dialogue, or listen to someone talk and have a conversation. - I am constantly re appropriating from my own source. It feels so odd. I am very much out of control. I only read non-fiction, I have a very hard time processing fiction yet I write fiction. The writing gets so exhausting that I feel like the only way out would be through suicide. I just don't want my creative process to be this messy all my life and wish I could be like those lit major guys who are sane and try to write instead of it being so explosive and disturbing. I am extremely afraid and paranoid about medication knowing what happens to boys my age who take it, I just don't know what to do. I'm giving up. I can't handle this. I can't handle having to write down that I used a towel over my door knob to open it because my hands were too wet. These details. Ouch. I have no idea why I do these things. I feel like everything is chasing after me, like my old emails are just laying there - and I need to go through them and delete things but I know I'll just be compiled to take notes. It's so horrifying, waking up everyday with this. EDIT: YES, I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PURE OCD and PTSD. My body does not feel real, nothing feels real - everyone is yelling at me. ALSO I AM SORRY IF I SOUND LIKE A NARCISSIST, BUT NONE OF MY ISSUES ARE IDIOSYNCRATIC. I am NOT playing the ""I'm special"" card because I'm not, if anything I am special-ed.
I can never feel happiness or snap out of the dreamlike state I am always in, like I am constantly in what people feel for 20 minutes when they watch Twin Peaks but then they can snap back into reality. The problem is, I've been on and off abusing stimulant drugs since last year. Sniffing Adderall XR and Ritalin recreationally, and now I got a scrip for 10mg of Ritalin IR and I railed it. The ironic part about this is I cut out Caffeine in March and have not had it since, the withdrawals were unbearable. So, why am I doing this? TO feel GOOD and to be reminded of what feeling good is like. I go through a cycle where I get the pills, I crush them up, I sniff them - I feel like shit and then I dump them. Then I wake up in the morning, seeing one line left on my bathroom counter and I go ""Do I do it? Do I do it? ONE LAST TIME!"" Last night before bed, I felt so sick. The entire room was spinning, I was ready to throw up - so nauseous. I could barely stand, I was rubbing my carpet. It was so wrong. I took ginger gravol, valerian root and chamomile and I eventually passed out but I woke up feeling sick. How long do side effects usually last? The thing is, i don't know how much i actually did. I did some in the bathroom in the morning, then I did some off of my backpack in the car, then I got home and did some but I didn't do the whole pills. Maybe this was more than 10mg? It's this constant, ""One more time!"" mentality. I just feel like since I am so suicidal, my brain has brought me to this point. It's so typical though, has an abusive youth and turns to drugs. I just don't want to go down this lonely road. It's pathetic already. I just run around in my underwear to blink-182 thinking that I am feeling what everyone else who is happy and posts pictures on Instagram of their perfect summers are. I don't drink also. Sorry, I don't know what to do. Hey, should I do that last line? I am terrified of long term effects of both.

My mom was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder about 15 years ago, give or take a few years (I was a pre-teen, so the exact year has kind of slipped past me). She medicated herself before that with a lot of drinking - I mean, a lot. Over the years, she saw a psychiatrist (who she saw for at least ten years before stopping, but recently just started seeing again) and has been on many different kinds of medications including Lithium, Topamax, Ambien, Seroquel, Lamictal, and Depakote. I'm sure there are others, but those are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head. 

She had her up and down days, just like most people suffering from Bipolar have. She was on a good streak for a while - one of her meds was working really well and she seemed to be as close to normal as I had seen her since I was probably 6 years old. That lasted for probably six months and then things started going downhill. 

Over the past three years, she has gotten delusional and I believe she's hearing (and possibly seeing) things. She's very, very paranoid and cannot reason with anyone about her mental illness any longer. I'm not sure I can pinpoint the time when it took a turn for the worst, but my now-fiance and I started noticing some strange things about 3-4 years ago. She'd wake up in the middle of the night (or just not sleep at all when she was manic) and start talking to her dogs like they actually were talking back. I mean, I talk to my cat, and I'm sure other people talk to their animals..but this was different. 

Once I moved out, I wasn't around her near as much so I didn't realize how bad it had gotten. I started to come over every weekend to visit my dad and that's when I noticed things weren't right. My fiance and I run a cell phone repair &amp; sales shop, so she'd ask us all these questions about her phone and how people were hacking into it, etc. No matter how many times we looked at both her phone and laptop and assured her that nothing was going on, she wouldn't believe us. Then she was sure people were hacking into her router and refused to even give the wifi password to us when we were over. She went through 5 phones in about two months because she was so convinced people were hacking into them. She even bought a go-phone from Walmart, new in the package, and somehow it had been hacked by the time she got home from the store. 

She started to tell my dad that he was keeping a large sum of money hidden from her from all the ""work"" she had done, and that my dad and his banker were stealing it from her. She hasn't worked in a good 15 years, since she has been dealing with her illness. Before then, it wasn't anything special - just a normal job. She started to get convinced that her probation officer was her partner IN THE TEXAS RANGERS, and as of today, she still believes she works for the Texas Rangers AND the Virginia State Police - we live in Texas and her family and she are originally from VA. She thinks she's broken up crime rings. She goes on and on about how her aunt used to work for the CIA and she (my mom) was born on an Airforce base so that gives her some kind of special....something. I don't know. 

She had a blog that she wrote in constantly - probably at least ten blog posts a day for at least a year. Those blogs were very wordy and didn't make any sense at all. Very unorganized thoughts. Recently, she managed to change her password on her computer, so she thinks it's hacked, and she's been taking her blogs to Facebook. It's rather embarrassing and frustrating, especially when she mentions me or my father in them. 

For the past year or so, my dad and I have caught her talking to herself. Just about three months ago, I started to notice she was contorting her face and making very strange facial expressions and moving her lips when no one was talking to her. I'm worried she has developed schizophrenia or another serious illness and she needs help. However, she absolutely refuses any help. 

In October of 2012, my dad and I managed to get a mental health warrant from our county judge, and the sheriff's department came out and served it. That was hell. They took her to a mental health facility here in our town and they transferred her to a mental hospital in Houston. It was an absolutely terrible hospital and they did nothing for her, our family, and just kicked her out as soon as her 72 hours were up. They were going to send her to a woman's shelter if we didn't come pick her up *right that instant*, even though we lived hours away and were given no notice that she was being released. I could go on and on about that...ugh. 

As soon as she got out of the hospital, she was just more angry at my father for putting her there and nothing was different. In fact, it may have made things worse. I'm terrified that she's going to end up hurting my dad because she believes that he is hiding/stealing money from her and setting her up to be ""raided"" or something else. 

Earlier this week, I made the decision to tell her that she needed to get help or she was not welcome at my wedding in October, because of her facial expressions and her strange behavior. I'm her only child/daughter, so I thought this would encourage her to get help. Nope. She told me to ""kiss off"", called me Dr. Phil, and also threatened to basically kick my ass. Very hurtful and EXTREMELY frustrating when all I'm trying to do is get her help. 

She recently visited her psychiatrist again, but my dad and I are both 100% certain she doesn't actually tell him what's going on, what she's hearing, etc - she claims the doctor has told her she is ""far from crazy."" 

I'll attach screenshots of some posts of hers so you can see her writing style and jumbled talk, as well as the conversation we had. 

We're located in Texas. The mental health system is an absolute joke and I have no idea where to go from here. I just want her to get some help but it's impossible when she refuses to accept the fact that she needs it. :( ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I need all the advice I can get for my mom. Please help!

It hurts for people to try to tell you that the pain you deal with in silence &amp; rage is not there. All my life, I've been told that I was doing everything I was doing for attention but I was just being myself, and those were never my direct intentions to this day. It still isn't. It is not angst, it is not being young, it is not being ungrateful. It is being ill and it is not something any of us want. Do you really think if we had a choice to not be this way, we would immediately stop in a heartbeat? Why would anyone fake this? Is another human's attention, all that important when all you really want is to feel happy? My past does make up of me, it has created me. What I am dealing with is my problem but also so many of us fight in silence never asking for sympathy or empathy, and yeah it must be hard for our family and friends to watch us dissolve but is it really our fault? Is it really our fault that some people can have had similar lives to ours, similar traumatic experiences and be able to react to their situation in a ""stronger"" way than us? No, it isn't.
You are not a narcissist or self indulgent or a brat.
Sure to some, it may seem like we have the luxury to be suicidal and depressed because of what look like privileged lives but do people not understand that what you feel and your experiences
I think it is very hurtful, it feels like ten thousand knives to the stomach when someone feels so entitled to tell you that your feelings aren't real, or your feelings are a phase. It is sick. So to everyone, all ages. I do not romanticize my sickness, nothing beautiful can come out of this and if something does - it was not intentional.
I don't know your pain, I don't know your battle because that is yours as an individual but I do know it is real, and you are feeling it and it hurts and I am sorry you have to be fighting this war.

We have been together for 7 years, married for 3. We have a 4 and 2 year old. 

About 18 months ago, he fell into a deep pit of depression, stopped going to work, left me and the kids because he said he 'didn't give a shit anymore so what's the point of being here'. This lasted about 3 months, then he came back to me, seeming to be in a better headspace and insisted that he was fine, it was just a rough patch and we should get back together and be a family again. I tried to ask him to get help, not necessarily medication, but therapy or counselling of some kind. He flatly refused, saying that he was fine, and verbatim said 'I don't need a fucking quack to tell me how I feel'. He has a serious aversion to psychologists, I don't know why. 
Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, we had an argument over something small and he's been in an awful depression spiral again. Shit hit the fan and we had a massive argument this morning, where he said he feels depressed (this is the first time he's actually acknowledged it) and anxious because we don't have much money. We've never been well off, and often live paycheck to paycheck, but we live in our own home, kids are always fed, and clothed, we've never had gas or power turned off, so I think in the grand scheme of things, we are doing ok!! 
I tried to encourage him to open up a bit more and suggested that if he's depressed, let's find a doctor who will help out. He basically screamed at me that he will NEVER talk to anyone about it. He said the only reason he feels like this is because we are poor, so it will be fixed when we have more money. 
After a bit of back and forth, he admitted that he feels like he doesn't give a shit about anything, he doesn't feel like he wants to be with me, and doesn't enjoy the kids (he said, they just give me the shits all the time) he also admitted to self medication with Speed a couple of weeks ago ( before we got together he was quite heavily into drugs). 

My question is, can anyone give me some advice about where to go from here? I love him  and I have built a family with this man, and I want him to get better. But I am convinced that he won't get help, so I don't know what to do from here.

When I was in elementary school, I was a seriously crappy child- horrible performance in school, horrible behavior, horrible social skills. And for some reason, whenever I got pissed (which was a lot) and threw tantrums, one of those things I always said was ""I'm going to kill myself."" I didn't actually plan on doing so; it was just something that popped into my head. Maybe I wanted the attention. Who knows. It just sort of sprung out of my immature anger episodes. Obviously the counselors there freaked out, and that wasn't very fun...

I transitioned to middle school, and then high school, and I guess all the anger management issues sorta dissipated. Don't throw tantrums, don't get angry very easily. Except sometimes, when I do get pissed, or whenever I think about conflicts going on currently, I might not have the outbursts of my youth, but sometimes the image of killing myself does pop up in my head.

The images take several forms. Sometimes it's with a gun, sometimes it's by drinking detergent or whatever. I don't picture actually committing the act, but sometimes I picture my lifeless body just lying there, sometimes someone I know finding me. Other times I picture myself about to do it before someone walks in. I consider the notes I'd write, the strategic choosing of the location, to find some sort of symbolic significance for it. Most commonly I picture people I know- a lot of people, friends, and teachers especially, but almost never my mother- finding out about the news and reacting to it. I suppose it's sort of a ""ha! Now they feel bad"" type of thing.

**In no way am I actually suicidal.** Whenever I think about this kinda crap, the emotions do run fairly intense. But I have plenty of reasons and no problem with convincing myself to live- and other times I just stop thinking about it and the episode is forgotten and the rest of the day is uneventful. To my perspective, it's just sort of a way my brain lets off steam, a weird remnant from my unstable elementary school years. By my judgement, it's not detrimental or major or anything.

I do realize that this sorta thing is hardly normal. I recently informed my mother of this stuff (Dad's divorced and lives out-of-state), and obviously she was seriously concerned, and definitely justified in being so. Even so, I tried to explain what I did in the fourth paragraph above, that to me, it's no big deal, but that expectedly didn't do much to quell her woes. She now worries that I'm too lonely at school (not the case), that I'm harboring anger within myself that I'm not revealing to her (not the case), that I have depression (extremely unlikely)... She's begun taking me to a counselor to talk about this, in the hopes that among other things (there are other issues I'm not divulging) I'll find ways to ""deal with anger more positively."" I go to my second visit tomorrow, and while I have no problem sitting and talking, completely honestly, I say it's a waste of time, a waste of money, and an overreaction.

Yeah, I know that's what mothers do, and I don't expect to change her view anytime soon...

But her concern is one that I should probably take into consideration. From what I've explained, do you think that these sorts of thoughts are dangerous? Unhealthy?

**TL;DR** In elementary school, had anger management issues and spouted phrase ""I'm gonna kill myself"" out of immaturity... now in high school, images of suicide pop into my head in response to anger or stress, though I don't have any plans or motivations and in general am a pretty normal guy. But is this safe?

Also, one more question- is this the correct subreddit? Or is /r/suicidewatch or /r/advice better suited?

I looked up the symptoms and I have most if not all of them, but the thing is I have these other symptoms too. Like every single day my mood just shifts. Like early in the morning I might feel really down like wanting to die because thats all I can conjure to numb the feeling. After that I might feel really happy like everything is ok and all I want to do is run and just be out. I have fantasies of just walking around like im not going anywhere in particular I just wanna run and go crazy. I might also feel erratic like not normal, just crazy I might not be able to be sane and think straight I just feel crazy and my skin feels itchy. Also back in my first shift I might feel angry and hate everybody like every single person is the enemy and I feel like a misanthropic. After that I just feel down not depressed just down. Then I just dont know how I feel, like I just don't know what to call it. I dont feel sad or erratic I just feel, well sort of. When I feel like that I think it might be happiness. I don't think I know what being happy feels like. Then after that I feel ok, I just rethink what I felt during that day and I think I'm going to be ok. Then it just starts all over again. I also have the urge to spit when repulsed. Like I just can't control myself. Like my mouth just fills with spit and or I have the urge to spit. I can't swallow because I feel like the spit is infected and that by spitting and ir washing my hands I am cleansing myself. Also I can't touch or look at the thing that repulsed me because I might have to spit and or wash my hands.

Im also repulsed by teeth and dolls and sometimes kids and babies I don't have a very close relationship to like siblings but I'm also repulsed by them to. I also sometimes twitch like I might try stop thinking about something that repulses me and just twitch. I have wierd relationships with people I might just hate them just for no reason.

One is a tough Scandinavian(Maybe Icelandic? She seems kind of nordic to me, especially her name, but I'm not sure of ""her"" ""county of origin"") woman, who wears a lot of dark and revealing clothing, and she's very confidant and sexually appealing. (Her words, not mine, I think my wife is always beautiful) and the other is softer woman, she is outgoing, wears bright colors and dresses, and jokingly calls herself a fairy queen, because she loves flowers or floral prints. She will go so far to wear wigs and makeup to further change her appearance. (Not completely odd, but she usually doesn't even wear makeup)

I don't know if I should be worried. She doesn't want to talk to a therapist about it, because she is happy and it seems to help her, and I don't know if there is a negative effect to this.

Though it worried me today when my wife told me she wanted people to refer to her as her persona's name when she is in that persona. These two persona's represent two big personality traits she **thinks** she is not, confidant and attractive.

She's also rarely referred to a third persona that used to ""take over for her"" when she was younger and afraid, but I've never personally seen this persona, or heard her mentioned in quite some time.

She's has been diagnosed with PTSD because of her traumatic childhood, and I've been suspecting for about 6 months that she might also be bipolar. I've been reading as much as I can about it, and I'm **not** self diagnosing, but it sound EXACTLY like her, and that worries me. She was taking a LOT of meds before she refused to see her therapist anymore and quit them all cold turkey and she hated it to the point that I have to fight her just to get her to take Advil for a headache. Her therapist didn't really care about her and would constantly and repeatedly tell her to do things that never worked for her, or she wouldn't tell her how to do them. (EX. Telling her multiple times to tap her hands when she is nervous, didn't work. Told her to buy anti itch cream for her She has anger problems, she bottles it up til she explodes, therapist told her to find a healthy outlet or way to express it. She asked for help on how because she honestly doesn't know, and she just kept saying ""Try something that works for you."" and then promptly ended the session 20 minutes early. It's only the first therapist we've tried, but it's kind of put her off the idea of therapists.) Her therapist also dismissed her self harm merely because it wasn't cutting. My wife hits herself very hard when she does something ""wrong"" or when she is frustrated, and she's left bruises on her hands and arms when she bites herself for the same reason. She also obsessively scratches and picks at things. I've managed to keep her from scarring her face, her chest and arms, but her shins/ankles look awful.

Her life flip flopped when she moved away from her father's house. She didn't even know anything was wrong with her until she left, because even though her father is an awesome guy, he isn't a doctors kind of person and has a lot of stereotypical misconceptions about mental health which make my wife afraid to talk to him about her problems.. She has chronic anemia (to the point that she would be so tired she would stop where she was and lay on the floor and fall asleep. Not like narcolepsy where she would just pass out, but she would get too tired to move, purposefully lay on the floor and then sleep) and was often told she just needed a nap. Luckily her dad is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so she was getting constant iron. But I can't afford that, so her only choice is iron pills, which make her sick. And most of her bad memories were repressed or she consciously ignored them and didn't even realize they were that bad.

It's frustrating as hell because I want so bad to help her. to see her run home and hug me excitedly when I come home from work like she used to when we first moved out together. But now she's so lonely and anxious sometimes she doesn't even get out of bed and just cries all day. Where we live, riding the bus isn't exactly convenient, and she gets extremely anxious even when in a car, so driving herself isn't an option now. She refuses to have roommates, because the last couple were awful. She spends the entire week home alone and she lives for the weekends, when we can leave the house together. She is terrified of leaving alone, because when she has an anxiety/panic attack, she completely shuts down, or just runs away. It's like fight or flight, but more like shut down or flight. 

She had an anxiety attack when she was walking home in the dark about two years ago when she missed her bus home and she shut down so badly I had to leave work immediately and hunt her down in the city. Nothing happened to her, to which I am immensely relieved, but now she's terrified of it happening again, so she just *doesn't* leave the house alone, unless it's to check the mail.

I'm trying to get us out of the apartment we're in at the end of our lease, which is soon, but she's being stressful about that too.

I'm sorry, this turned into a kind of rant, but I guess I needed to let it out. If someone has some advice for me, please **PLEASE** message me or reply. I'm so desperate to see my wife smile again that I would do anything. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Wife has multiple personalities/personas?

1) I once went to school just like every other day but since the begining of the day i felt something is going to be wrong it wasn't right and i was so sure something is going to happen to me at school this day, an hour later the administrator of school called me when i was in class telling me about smthg bad and almost gave me a detention.

2) at home just like every other day we get calls sometimes my friend of a long time calls me but when he does i can feel from the phone ringing it's him not someone else and wait the phone to be given to me even before seeing the number because i know so sure it's him.

3) Once i had cards in my hand i picked like 5 randomly and closed them didnt see them so i dont know how i was focusing and while turning the card i said the number and it was right for the first time i was shocked between 13 different kinds i got it right i tried again got it right again tried the third and got it right then i started going it randomly without focusing but failed, im  not sure if that's a coincidence.

4) last time i was talking to my girlfriend on whatsapp while online she sometimes disconnected went a minute off and back on for several times because of the 4G connnection later on when she went off again i knew and i felt she went on snapchat to send a picture 2 mins later i recieved a picture on snapchat from her

5) Sometimes while talking to my girlfriend she tells me for example wanna know what happened today or guess what happened today or stuff like that even before she tells me sometimes my heart beats are normal because i know it's nothing bad or anything i'll be worried about but sometimes my heartbeats go crazy because i can feel it's something wrong that what she wants to tell me will bother me and maybe hurt me ( texting )

6) Last time i was at the mall on a store searching the laptop and investiating it and suddenly i felt like someone is watching me that's not the first time it happens but i felt like someome is watching i looked to the place i felt it was no one was there, once again it happened to me before while walking in the dark near woods and felt like someone is watching that didn't go away until i got far from the woods.

And many others so i was wondering is that coincidence? or what's wrong and if there is any name to this situation or anything i would like explanations",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,sensing things before they happen or while happening?

My story is a bit long, but I'd appreciate any perspective on this, professional or otherwise. I was researching a situation I'm dealing with and I encountered the article above. I think it describes my situation pretty well, but I want to check myself before I proceed.

I am having a series of conflicts with a co-worker who I believe exhibits these traits, but I am having difficulty persuading my chain of command towards my observations. If I could objectively demonstrate how his pattern undermines our unit cohesion and efficiency (and, my own happiness), I might be able to enlist my supervisors' aid in improving the morale and effectiveness of the shop.

So, here's the situation. I only recently arrived at this duty station and I'm having trouble fitting in. There are multiple elements that I could attribute to that, some within my control and some without. One persistent factor is the hostile interactions I have with my direct supervisor, I'll call K. I believe this individual either consciously or subconsciously plays into people's weaknesses to encourage submission, or to get a rise out of them in order to undermine their credibility.

We have another marine in our shop, I'll call P, who is very much abused by K. K verbally abuses him, sabotages his ability to succeed by stealing or disorienting his property, and in some cases have hit him or hazed him. There is no evidence of these events, save what had been confided in me before our conflicts began.

So, these are some specific interactions I have had with K:

""We're so glad you are who you are, man. We just didn't want you to turn out like P.""

""Just try to take it easy man, nobody wants you to turn into P.""

""We're just worried about you. Everyone is starting to think you have anger management problems. We just don't want you to turn out like P.""

I believe his animosity towards me spiked because of a day in which I disobeyed an order he gave me which I disagreed with. He had ordered me to walk directly behind him as if in formation (something nobody truly does in garrison anymore). It seemed to me he was trying to make an example of his authority, but as he had recently been highly verbally abusive towards P, I was disinclined to follow him, and certainly disinclined to validate his leadership. Regardless of my violation, this incident seemed severe because there was a notable increase in the number of comments like the examples above, which essentially threaten my social standing.

Now, K has confided in me that they have historically stolen objects, including at least one Department of Defense ID card, from P, in order to sabotage his ability to perform as a marine. On the same day I disobeyed this obtuse order, my socks went missing from my locker during noon PT. Now, this is strange in any circumstance. Nobody would want another man's socks. Nobody would show up to the office without their own socks and desperately go scavenging for someone's to steal. I cannot prove K stole them, but perhaps you see my thinking on this.

So, following my platoon sergeant's advice, I had a direct, professional dialogue with K in which I explained the behavior that was upsetting me. I cited the examples I gave you above as types of condescension, disrespect, and attempts to undermine my credibility. K became angry and insisted that his accusations were fundamentally true, emphasizing that I was like P, and everyone thinks I have anger management problems (my platoon sergeant insists nobody thinks I have anger management problems).

There's the story as it stands right now, summarized as best I could. I see several instances in which this individual deliberately lied, self confession of willingness to violate federal law to punish non-conformity, and positive and negative manipulation to threaten my social standing.

If you've read this far, I'm so grateful. I feel I've done a good bit of the research, but I would greatly appreciate your input on the matter. Am I way off here? Is there anything you would add to my analysis? Most importantly: If I am on the right track, how can I describe this situation in an professionally credible way that demands a response from my superiors? Put another way, how can I make this somewhat abstract series of interactions really black and white, simple to understand and respond to?

Here goes. I'll preface this by saying that I am not conceited. I am painfully aware of my shortcomings. **Be critical and honest about what you see. I am not the sensitive type. Give me blunt honestly or don't comment at all.**

**Background**

I've never been able to maintain any longterm friendships nor have I ever been in a romantic relationship. Throughout high school and the beginning of college, I talked way too often, fixated on individuals, and I tried way to hard to make friends. I was insecure, petty, and extremely vain. People would eventually stop taking me seriously, I was bullied, and I was seldom invited to social gatherings. I still had ""friends"" who didn't completely resent me and I would sometimes hang out with them. 

At times, I was charming, charismatic, and the life of the parties and gathering that I did happen to get invited to. My annoying, confrontational, neurotic side won out though and ended up repulsing people away. Like I said, I hung out with people, but they didn't like me much. I ended up living alone my second year of college because I couldn't find someone willing to be my roommate.

Second year marked a huge transformation in my personality. In the beginning of the school year I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and was prescribed generic adderall. Suddenly the 19 year everlasting storm in my head had stopped. I could think clearly.

My grades improved dramatically to a near-perfect GPA and my personal outlook did a complete 180. I grew thick skin, stopped taking myself so seriously, and my ego deflated. My self-esteem increased due to my more accurate appraisal of my own strengths and shortcomings. My insecurities vanished. There was nothing critical that anyone could say to me that I hadn't considered myself. In fact, I began to welcome any sort of criticism directed my way. My own personal bias disappeared and I began to see things very objectively. (this plays into the end issue that I will present). My thinking became very logic based and outcome-oriented

I took up BJJ (which I love). I  became very introverted. Incessant chatting became the past. I spent long periods of time isolated in my dorm studying, reading, or watching movies. I stopped feeling sorry for myself and others and found self-pity to be petty and pathetic. I only communicated with others in class-related or BJJ-related situations and then only when absolutely necessary. Even in the public I was isolated; I would go days without speaking to others. 

I stopped caring about making those durable relationships that I was so preoccupied with years prior. It just seemed to be a high-effort/low-reward endeavor and ultimately a waste of time. I just accepted that I am socially broken/not wired to have longterm relationships. I wasn't happy or sad about it. I just felt acceptance.

That school year, the only time I felt any emotion was was when I boxed or practiced BJJ. During those times I felt joy and aggression. Existence aside from that was numb. Although my actions became more efficient on adderall, I became possessed by constant stress-induced suicide ideation motivated purely by laziness.

I was (and still am) indifferent about living or dying. I can work hard, study, and lift or I can kill myself and end those tedious obligations. I almost went through with hanging myself but decided instead to just keep working. When summer came my workload decreased and my thoughts of suicide vanished completely. 

Now it's the summer. I don't talk often and I still get social fatigue; I'm suddenly grasped by an intense urge to retreat after prolonged social exposure (few hours). 

I rarely feel empathy or any strong emotion. Any emotion that does manage to surface is very suppressed and diluted. I don't care for other peoples' feelings and insults don't phase me. Recently I found out a close relative died. Felt nothing. My response was ""ok."" 

I work with a doctor and I've seen patients in situations where I know I should be feeling something for them. ""Insurance won't cover this critical operation"" or ""I lost my job and can't afford this important life sustaining operation."" All accompanied by waterworks. Don't feel anything. Not sadness, pity, anger, or disdain. Just nothing. The doctor told me that I'm robotic and unnatural. I apparently lack charm and charisma. 

**My major issue**

He's right. I am a robot. I naturally speak unnaturally. I feel no empathy. I calculate my actions with a specific goal in mind. My responses are the same. Even when they are honest, they are designed to elicit a desired response. It shows. Potential employers will think that I am either disingenuous and/or  I lack confidence because of my cadence. I think very objectively. My ego is virtually non-existent. My way of operating has always helped me achieve my academic and physical goals. It's not going to help me achieve my career goals. I need help. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Looking for an opinion

A few months ago I started getting some pretty crazy hallucinations and went to the ER. Since then, I've been seeing a psychologist and we've been trying to diagnose what's going on, but I feel like I'm getting worse and it's stepping up quickly. Half of the time I don't even feel like a person anymore. I have frequent memory lapses and occasional delusional thoughts which don't seem like they stem from any kind of logic. The other morning I woke up 100% convinced that I'd killed someone the past night even though I knew that I hadn't and I was accounted for the entire night through. Today the doctor asked me if I've ever met anybody with emotional responses in line with mine. I couldn't think of anyone real, but I realized that Patrick Bateman in American Psycho isn't so far off, as long as you discount the whole murderous rampage thing. Our emotions, except in rare circumstances, just aren't there.

now, onto the problem, ive been like this for way too long now and I need to get my life together, all the way through my school life my I struggled with actually attending, id always make excuses to go in, pretend to be sick and such things, it just got worse and worse. through my 4th year of highschool (this is scotland so I was 16 at the time) things took a dive. fast forward one year and im screwing everything up, by the end of the year I had about 50% attendance and ive failed 3 out of my 5 exams, and gotten very low grades on what I didn't fail. im lucky, with those two low grades I get into a college course. fast forward 4 months, its february at the time, ive quit the college course, it was going so well, I could be in university by now doing chemical engineering, but no, im practically incapable of getting out of bed, I procrastinate homework, I even skip classes, I just cant do it anymore. I do nothing until september the same year (2013) where I start a new college course in games development. amazing right? I get to do something im incredibly passionate about, I loved it, the people there were great and the lecturers were super nice. the year doesnt even end before I give up, I tell everyone I know I didnt enjoy the course, its all lies, I just couldn't even get my body to move in the mornings, my mind was already set on not going, it happened every week, I missed so many classes, I couldnt bring myself to even so much as try to fix things so I give up. again. its august now as you all know, I started a job 4 weeks ago, I got fired yesterday, I missed 2 thursdays in a row on my 4 day a week shift, and last week I didnt go in 3 of the 4 days. I just stayed in bed, with my family worried about me losing my job, and I was completely and utterly apathetic towards the whole thing, I just said to myself ""I dont even fucking care if I get fired, ill just lie here til I die for all I care"" (which brings up another point altogether, frequent suicidal thoughts, straight up wanting to just rot and die) and here I am now, its august, my 19th birthday is in two weeks, my life is a trainwreck. im not going to be able to get employed anywhere, no college will be willing to accept me, soon I fear my family wont even accept me.

tl;dr 

im incredibly prone to being bedridden, and my apathy towards my future life is crippling me, im sitting here right now contemplating how im going to tell my family about my newest complete failure, I just hope they didnnt believe in me

Well heres the thing, I wasn't doing these dangerous things because I was sad anymore. I was doing it because I was so damn happy, energetic, and restless. This feeling lasted for about two months until it stopped. I started to feel a bit down, even a little numb. Then I got into the most petty argument with my boyfriend and I get so angry. This isn't a normal ""oh don't talk to me"" angry. It was unbelievable. I was telling him the most terrible things that really could be considered verbal abuse. For weeks I bounced between being unbelievably angry to unbelievably sad. I couldn't stop, I was even becoming a bit violent, and tried my best not to physically hurt anyone by locking myself in my room and harming myself many times a day. For 2 months I verbally abused my boyfriend and bounced between rage and depression. Suddenly it all stopped and all I felt was very mildly depressed. Now I'm kind of numb. I bounce between mild hopelessness and numbness everyday. I had two very drastic mood changes within a six month period and they're not at all just the ""normal"" teenage moodiness.

I've been having on-going mental health issues since the age of 16 but it's coming to a time now where I really need to sort my shit out. My boyfriend is moving from a completely different country to be with me next month and I'm currently not working because Doc says I am not mentally stable enough at the minute. I have no money. I should be excited. **SO excited.** I've waited a year and a half to be with him but my brain is saying: 

&gt; ""I just can't be excited right now.""  

I want to be excited for this. This is the next step in my life and I have never wanted anything to work out so badly. How can I picutre my future if I can't even think straight or cope well with day-to-day life?


Now to the main point: 

For the past two years, I've been coping with things by smoking weed. It started off as just something that was happening every Saturday night but now I smoke as much as I can when I can. I **know** it's not good, I'm using it as a way to get by in daily life. A coping mechanism. 

Sometimes, though, I don't have weed or cannot get weed. I'm fine for the first day but I slowly start to wear away. By the second day I won't eat as much and I have trouble sleeping, I cry over nothing and get incredibly agitated if things don't work out 100% how I pictured it in my head. 

I know this is a bad sign and I don't really know what to do. I have my first psychotherapy session on Monday afternoon and I am utterly terrified about attending it.

There is no cause of death yet. I don't know how to express the pain and the misery I am feeling, his family is feeling, everyone is feeling. I have been writing him letters, and talking to him aloud, and speaking to a bereavement counselor I know thorough my job at a school, which has been incredibly helpful. I loved him, and I know he loved me, and that I think, is enough.

My father on the other hand...first, here is some background to my problem...

My fiance was a physics professor, working on his thesis to get his doctorate. He was a very smart man. I don't know how to ""do"" math, or physics, so his numerous notebooks and papers are nothing but confusing numbers and letters to me. When he died, he was working on his thesis, and put it aside momentarily to watch tv, and he died in his sleep. I had the idea to give his unfinished work to a few of his professors, who knew what he was working on and could possibly finish it in his honor. It would be a waste to do anything else, I feel. I have a vauge idea of what he was working on, but I really truly don't know. 

My father called me up, the night of the funeral around 1am, and was telling me that my phone was bugged...and my apartment was bugged...and that I wasn't safe. He wanted to come over right away and stay with me and protect me. He wouldn't go on any further. I was terrified, and called my mother (they are divorced). She called him and he told her that the government killed my fiance over his work in physics and they were coming for me now. He said that he could feel it, he was having premonitions of it, and he had to protect me. My mother called me back and told me all of this, and then rushed over to pick me up. Before she got there, he got there. I wouldn't go outside until she was outside to get me. He is my father, but, he was scaring me. When I left, he was at the door, and he was trying to pull me away from the door because my apartment was bugged and I was being watched. He very lucidly explained that the US Government had shot down the Malaysian airplane because it had 10 scientists on it trying to bring secrets into China, and now China wants to get back at us and is killing our scientists, which included my fiance. He said that he was working for the government and that there was foul play involved in his death and that unless I handed over all of my fiance's papers to the professors, who were actually government employees, I would be next. I got in the car with my mother, told him that I thought he was overreacting, that IF my fiance was working for the government he would have at LEAST had health insurance (Obama care, sigh), but reasoning with him wasn't working. I later called my two uncles to help, and after speaking to him they were without words but said that it seems my father means well, but.... 

I don't know what to do. My dad called me again, yesterday, and it was the same thing as before. I feel as if my dad cannot understand my fiance's death (they were close) and because my father listens to an indecent amount of talk radio all day and is on anti depressants and pain medications (bad knee) and the sort, there might be some vauge mental health issues peeking out. My fiance's brother suggested I remain cordial, but keep my distance in a way, and maintain boundaries and just tell my father that I am refusing to discuss it, and I will talk to him about anything else but I won't entertain this idea.

14 years later I can't put me out of this decision. Few arguments were given besides a diagnosis given in hurry.

My two psychologists with doctorate are working on this for about 3 years.

I gathered an entire blog with 1200 posts and some documentaries. I made a work on neuroscience proving the medicines effects on me.

I went to another psychiatrist of a public health center and told her that they were medicating my personality. She made a report saying that I had nothing and that I could reduce my medication.

Now we are going to pay 500R$ (about 250U$) per appointment to a psychiatrist that understands my psychologist side and allow that I stop the medication and for that my family allow me to take the medication, even though I'm 29 years old and I'm an adult.

All of this because to follow the psychiatrist warning tranquilizes the family and make them not realize that were part of my problems.

I'm fairly new to reddit and it's culture but I'm just looking for honest responses. This is a post from facebook. This girl was trying to make a point saying that mental illness can cause terrible self-harm and a lot of people are too afraid to speak about this subject. But she was speaking out about it and trying to say ""yes I cut myself because I don't know how to escape this suffering but I know this isn't the way to do it."" She was trying to help people going through what she is. She cuts herself too but this isn't the right way.

The response(most not all) to this was accusations of trying to garner sympathy or get attention. How can you get that out of what she's saying? Is that what it sounds like to anyone? I personally did not believe she was trying to make people feel sad for her but make people see that hurting yourself doesn't help. She was talking to people like her but most people saw it as some kind of attention grabbing stunt. I just want to know does anyone here think this?

It's my main method of coping. The physical exertion keeps me level and keeps me from sh.

My therapist recently started to try and do some digging, as she doesn't believe my symptoms/behaviors/whatever necessarily fit what my pdoc diagnosed. Long story short I finally opened up about various forms of abuse from my father and older cousins from early childhood, and details about my interpersonal relationships and patterns and past attempts. I finally let out some things about some childhood trauma, and she locked on to BPD. She's been circling around BPD for the past few months, but I didn't really trust her enough to open up about it all. And reading up on it, I think she's right. 

So I see my pdoc next Saturday, but I'm not extremely comfortable with bringing it up. I feel like I would be out of line and I don't want to leave another appointment embarrassed. I know psychiatrists don't serve the same role as therapists, but I feel like my therapist may be right. I mean she's the one I've been talking to and talking to, where as when I see the psychiatrist it's really ""oh do you feel sad? anxious? how's the sleep? okay here's the script see you in three weeks."" He seems quite removed, and it makes me very uncomfortable. All he asks about is those three things. He's never expanded upon actual behaviors. Just basic emotions, I guess you could say. He never asked about my relationships with others or personal history. I don't know, I'm just extremely scared to bring it up. I'm not very comfortable around any of them, so I don't really know what to do. Thanks!

Sometimes I feel it's just I 'can't handle the truth/the real world' or something. Like I'm a delicate snowflake for feeling the way I do. Recently I was shot down because a friend called me a 'pussy' for not drinking (triggers anxiety he doesn't understand) and not eating dessert (was full/have had history of ED he doesn't know about). I said this 'triggered' my experience of my mental health at its worst; I was told not to use that term, I don't have PTSD (I don't, only GAD which is now mild-moderate but was moderate-severe). 

Another time I spoke to my learning mentor about how a literary character I was reading made me feel inadequate because of their social superiority and mastery of self-control/toughness (the most common one is Superman, actually). 

Recently my family (who are aware of my experience with ED) have started making fat jokes etc. again around the table/talking about needing a diet. They're not being malicious or insensitive to me, but I still notice it and I guess on *bad* days it affects me. 

I'm wondering whether this just means I'm…really sensitive? I mean I shouldn't be losing sleep just from watching fictitious rape or a person having their eyes gouged out before bed…should I?

sorry for the huge wall of text or any spelling errors, there's just so much to say and I don't know where to go at all. i don't even know if this is the right subreddit, but it seems like it is.

___

I hear voices in general. Talking to each other, being rude to each other, being rude to me, threatening to hurt me, telling me to hurt myself, trying to discourage me from doing tasks (things like going to school, or going out for planned events, that kinda thing), trying to convince me that certain things will happen (the house will catch fire, i'll drown if I have a bath, ect) whistling, humming, and I also see things, 3 things; people in suits with 3 different animal heads. They don't really do anything, they just wander around, sometimes looking at other people (as in, real people) - they don't bother me as much.

None of these things ever really stop, they're just kinda always happening. The voices are more pushy when I'm stressed out, but a part from that, they're just in the background doing what they do.

I would never do something just because they told me to, I definitely don't see them as being real - But I have considered killing myself just because they kept getting to be too intense, and mental health people (counselors, psychiatrist, the like) would just keep on about how ""they're just my thoughts"" and ignoring them.
___

Anxiety is a big problem. I can't go outside because I feel like something terrible will happen to me or to the people I love; being run over, being mugged, being attacked by something, me getting lost, just danger overall. Sometimes it doesn't bother me too much, but then other times I'll freak out to the point of crying and shaking- Once I ended up going to A&amp;E because people were worried about my heart rate it was so bad.

Things also have to be 'my' way. Not neat, or tidy, but the way I put them. I don't like being in control of things, or being in charge, but I just have things how they are because it makes me feel safe. If they aren't how I put them, I start worrying about things, like my family members getting ill, or being attacked. It happened a lot when I was little and I would usually end up nagging and nagging until I was allowed to talk to whoever I was worried about, but now I just keep it to myself because I don't want to freak out the people I live with.

When I do panic, I do kinda odd things. I pick at and scratch the skin on my knuckles, I bite the skin on either side of my finger nails until it hurts, I scratch the bump under my chin (I have a horrible butt chin), I rub my knees/thighs, I don't notice that I'm doing any of it either, I just do it without thinking.

___

I don't really know what to refer to this as, I haven't really heard of it happening before, i can't really explain it that well either. Sometimes I'll just forget where I am and everything'll feel really out of touch. It's like when you lean on a limb for too long and it feels like it's disappeared, but I have it everywhere. I can't really sense anything, with my ears, nose, or touch, i'm just kind of 'here' but not here. I feel like I need to grab onto something, or else I'll stay like that forever, and sometimes I feel like I'm facing away from a huge drop and that I need to grab onto something in order to stay balanced. It's really scary, I'm so lucky that i've never had it outside.

___

i also have problems with gender things. I don't feel comfortable being in a female body, or when people use a female name to call me. But at the same time, a male body doesn't sound right for me either, even though people calling me a he feels right. I've been like that since I was about 9-10 years old, and it's been getting worse and worse. I've considered killing myself a few times because of it, i just feel so uncomfortable being like this and there's no way to get away from it, it's just unbearable. 

___

I haven't been to school since last year, so social services got involved and I was referred to a mental health service. the counselor was rude, interrupted me, and basically said ""well we all feel like that at one point, you just need to get better"" for the first 3 or so sessions. she was so condescending and standoffish, I eventually couldn't go and missed quite a lot of sessions with her. 

We asked for a new counselor, and they said no, but eventually I got to speak to a psychiatrist over the phone. she kept interrupting me, and was absolutely adamant that I was just hearing my own thoughts, and that what I saw was tricks of the light. 

they closed my case and referred me to some systemic therapy service (or group), who referred me back to them. i had a meeting with the psychiatrist two days ago, and it went terribly. 

She interrupted us like everybody else has, and also went off on some tangents about how so and so has done ___ amount of research, and how she has a somethingsomething in psychology, so therefor we know nothing and have no right to question her at all. 

she won't acknowledge the gender problems because ""they probably started due to all of the stress"" (the stress that didn't exist when it started, mind you), the voices and things i see are still just my thoughts and tricks of the light, and the anxiety is an untouchable subject because of my lack of routine. 

My sleeping schedule is sometimes messed up, and I spend most of my time just chatting to friends online, screwing about with games, that kinda thing, so i don't really go out much, well i can't.

She says that we ""Can't begin to analyze the past, because my current life is a mess"", like I wasn't sitting right there and talking to her then and then, right? it's not that hard for me to sort out my sleep schedule, I just have no reason to.

she finished off by, basically, saying that she won't do anything until I sort out my life, go out more, and socialize. that's why i went to see her in the first place, i can't do those things at all. 

my grandma is furious (i basically live with her), my mom had to sit down for a minute she was so ticked off at her, the systemic therapist agrees that it went terribly, but we can't do anything. 

there's a gender specific group on the other side of town, but i probably can't see them because it's on file that I've had such a terrible start and I'm ""unreliable and unwilling to work"" (they haven't offered any help what so ever, they just tell me to sort out my life)

___

I've been crying on and off for the past few days, I just don't know what to do, I don't think that there's anything I can do. I just want somebody who I can talk to that won't interrupt me, won't be judgmental and won't act like I have to prove that I need help in order to even be listened to.

I just want to die so much. I've messed up things already with these two people, so i've fucked up my chances of anybody ever taking me seriously, and nobody wants to listen to me about anything. I can't do it at all, I have nowhere to go, I'm just a mess.

I've been dating my girlfriend for a year, but known her for longer, but until recently I never truly considered she might be suffering from any psychological disorder other than low self esteem. But recently things have come to light and I've reflected on past events and come to the conclusion that she may be emotionally immature. 

She's suffered from crippling anxiety since I met her, but during our relationship I've identified a lack of emotional responsibility. She often acts without consideration, and when I confront her about it she becomes submissive and hysterical (even more so recently). I know that her home life wasn't without it's own problems, specifically her father who is one to scold her and apologize later.

I've mentioned that counseling would be beneficial to helping her self esteem and managing anxiety in the past but she wasn't open to the idea. She felt that her parents would see her as a failure and she confessed in her youth she went to a therapist and didn't have a good experience. However it's become clear to me the reason she does not want to attend therapy is the same reason she should. I know I can't control her, but I want to try and help her because it could be years from now or longer before she makes that realization. Or worse, I feel that she can be a danger to herself during her periods of depression and anxiety.

I don't know what to do or how to go about it. To think I can do this alone is irresponsible and letting it go on for this long is too. I've put a strain on myself the entire relationship thinking all she needed was someone who cares about her, but Im not as blind anymore.

Looking for a lil help in the direction I want to go.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 last summer after I tried to jump off a bridge.  I was on a low dose of lithium for the first half of the year or so but I stopped taking my meds.  I chose to do this for a couple reasons.  My biggest being that I feel that there is some sort of spiritual lesson to be learned from all this.  I stumbled across this article one day that sums up my views a bit better than I can myself. [The Shamanic View On Mental Illness](http://www.jaysongaddis.com/2010/11/the-shamanic-view-of-mental-illness/)

&gt;What those in the West view as mental illness, the Dagara people regard as “good news from the other world.”  The person going through the crisis has been chosen as a medium for a message to the community that needs to be communicated from the spirit realm.  “Mental disorder, behavioral disorder of all kinds, signal the fact that two obviously incompatible energies have merged into the same field,” says Dr. Somé.  These disturbances result when the person does not get assistance in dealing with the presence of the energy from the spirit realm.

&gt;...in the West are not trained in how to deal or even taught to acknowledge the existence of psychic phenomena, the spiritual world.  In fact, psychic abilities are denigrated.  When energies from the spiritual world emerge in a Western psyche, that individual is completely unequipped to integrate them or even recognize what is happening.  The result can be terrifying.  Without the proper context for and assistance in dealing with the breakthrough from another level of reality, for all practical purposes, the person is insane.  Heavy dosing with anti-psychotic drugs compounds the problem and prevents the integration that could lead to soul development and growth in the individual who has received these energies.

That last bit about anti-psychotics compounding the problem resonates with me.  I feel that I can offer this world so much more if only I can figure out how to hone my ups and downs.  If I'm on meds, then I feel I'm just your average run-of-the-mill person.  Who am I without this affliction anyways?  When you have a life of ups and downs, you become used to it.  Sure I suffer, I am right now, but who am I truly and how does medication take away from that?

My question for you guys is has anyone found any effective natural, spiritual or physical ways of coping with bipolar disorder?  I recently got back from a trip where I visited my long distance boyfriend in another state.  Ever since I've been home I've been lonely, depressed, and unmotivated.  It started with a fight with my very best friend whom things appear to never be the same again.  The other night I blew up at my roomate and her boyfriend because I'm sick of feeling like the third wheel and having him around literally all the time when he doesnt pay anything to live here.  Now shes moving out, and we were friends before this.  My boyfriend tries to be there for me, but he works 60+ hours and is half the country away.  Theres hardly anytime to talk and now we've just been fighting as well.  Thoughts of suicide have surely crept back into my mind and I find myself just laying in bed all day because I feel like if I get up and do anything, its just gonna be harmful to myself.  My boss and coworkers have noticed a change in me and are starting to express concern.  My parents are supportive these days, but my moms first answer to everything is ""medication.""  I dont want to tell them all of my dark feelings because it will worry them and theres nothing they can do.  They spent thousands of dollars putting me in a hospital last year, and more in years prior to that.  How could I do that again to them?  They couldnt always keep up with payments and it has affected my credit too.  I see a therapist, and she knows a bit about it but I feel like when I see her I'm usually not in a bad mood and I forget to mention all this.  A lot of our conversations center around relationships, school, and work.

Just to warn you, I've been holding a lot of stuff in and I kind of just need to let it out. No one really has to read it but I've got to put it out there. If you do read it I thank you very much and appreciate any caring advice you can give me. :) I've got two main issues going on here first off is my unemployment position. The second one is my social state.

   So first off Today I found out I'm a victim of identity theft, I recently filed for unemployment. I was working for a company that was bought out and absorbed by another company which than outsourced all of our jobs to people willing to do lower quality work for cheaper. It came completely out of the blue, originally we were all under the impression that we were going to be merging into a partnership with them but both companies would ultimately stay independent and we'd keep our jobs. They interviewed all of us the day they came in and took over however I only know of three people who actually have jobs, some people they said they were hiring and offered a job on the spot but called them two days later saying they apologized but the position had been filled. This is kind of stressing me out, a lot of the people I worked with were good friends of mine and some of them are in real jams now. I don't really know how to approach this, it's stressing me out, even worse when I go to sign up for unemployment while I go job hunting and find out that I have several work histories in states I've never been in using my social security number. Sounds like Identity theft, I can't think of anything else it would be. Don't know how long it's been going on for and now that's stressing me out too.

   Second major issue, my social life. I'm kind of okay at talking to people, I'm not great at continuing or starting conversations. I can't really do small talk very well, and most of the conversations I do have get really philisophical or are based on scientific discoveries, or technological advancements that excite me. Most people I know and like don't get excited by these, so to make up for it I try to be as genuine of a person as I can. I try to be very loyal to the people that I'm friends with, I care about them and I try listening, most of the time I try listening for the sake of listening so that they can get whatever they need to off their chest. If someone wants advice I'll do everything in my power to help them, I build them up, I tell them any hardship they are going through is something normal and that they can triumph over it, and that I believe in them. I try to do this for everyone even if they aren't my friend, mostly because that's the kind of person I want to be. After a while though people start taking me for granted, they kind of assume I'll always be there and ignore me unless they need to talk to someone that they couldn't talk to normally, and as much as I listen to everyone no one really reciprocates that no one really wants to hear my story and so I don't know it hurts, I know some people care about me, but I have trouble expressing appreciation for the ones that do, and talking, I don't really express myself verbally very well. I say thank you a lot, but there's a kind of diminishing returns with that statement when you use it so often.

   I'm not very old, I'm in my early twenties, I've never had a girlfriend and I've never had sex, most of the time I'm okay with that, I know it's not healthy to do that, and that I should do something about it, find some healthy relationship to get into. but I don't know how. I'm really insecure about my sexuality and don't know how to approach it, I think I always thought that I was better then sex, that it was some kind of arbitrary thing that wasn't needed. Once I got older and started going through highschool I longed for a physical interaction and moreso then that someone that I could love and who would love me back, for who we are. I didn't find someone like that in highschool sadly, no one that I really connected with, however about four months ago I did find a girl like that, someone who's been through a incredulous amount of very difficult situations, but she's so strong willed and so against quitting and victimizing herself that she's climbed out of every negative situation she's been in, and when things get bad again she says shit happens and moves on. 

   I am a very intelligent individual and as such most people look up to and expect solutions from me, whether they be people I work with, my friends or my family. She wasn't really an exception, we worked together and we became pretty good friends. She made some hints that she wanted to be more then friends but I have no clue what to do. I froze up, once when I was playing video games with some friends and she was kind of tipsy, and she hug tackled me from behind I rolled over so that I wasn't obscured physically or visually from competing with my friends in the game, and in the process she ended up laying on the couch, no one got hurt. (If I could go back now I would have thrown the controller down and just hugged her back.) We got even closer then that afterwards, she started confiding in me some of her fears and the things that stress her out the most or some of the events in her life that hurt her the most. I ended up telling her I loved her through some sappy text when she was away visiting some family, she didn't respond for a while so I expanded onto that saying that I wanted her to let her know that she is worth being loved and a good person, it got kind of awkward after that for a little bit, but she recognized my genuineness and we worked past it. 

   I build her up a lot, when we first met, she told me that I'm one of the most brilliant and intelligent people that she knows and that I'm certainly smarter then she is, I didn't want her to think that so I slowly build up her confidence with her strengths, trying to explain that the things she could do that I couldn't worked together to make her a very brilliant person, and that she's very talented, because she is. As time went on, I still never made any kind of physical move, but we are still very close, now that we all lost our jobs she became really stressed out, over the past few days we started drifting apart. I don't want that to happen, I don't want to stop being her friend, I haven't even kissed her but I want to love her and hold her. I'm pretty sure she wants the same thing, she wanted to get me drunk after finding out that I'd never been drunk, I was almost positive the reason was to kickstart a loving physical relationship between us, not sex but she expressed cuddling several times while I was under the influence, it didn't really work out, turns out I get really obnoxious and try to teach people complex quantum mechanics equations when I get drunk(which I wrote incorrectly and explained horribly.) I end up talking and rambling a lot and so nothing really happened.

   I guess I'm not very grown emotionally, I'll need to work on that, maturing myself so that I can sustain this relationship longer, I know I need to talk to her, say something. I don't know how to approach the subject I don't know how to start it or where to go. I'm very lost at the moment. I feel alone, I'm tired, I'm stressed out, and anxious and my apartment is a mess, and it stinks, and I need to take a shower, and being hung over is a terrible experience. Thank you for listening and I lovingly appreciate any constructive comments you people may provide.

What you're saying when you say you eat 3 meals a day is that:

1. You bought enough food for 3 meals ALL at once
2. You woke up early enough to necessitate 3 meals
3. You had an appetite sufficient to make breakfast upon waking up and the food you find appetizing is IN THE HOUSE.
4. You made breakfast, and ate it
5. Later in the day, you got hungry AGAIN, and had an appetite for something that you actually have in the house, and you got up and did this whole exhausting process again.
6. After lunch, you got hungry, once again, for things you have IN THE HOUSE that you CAN MAKE YOURSELF and you acted upon that urge with the same clairvoyant confidence of someone who cooks without care. (alliteration, hehe)
7. In between all this, you got other things done and even exercised or generated capital, as this laundry list surely indicates that you are healthy enough to be employed.
8. You washed dishes, stored leftovers in tupperware, and actually regarded leftovers as a functional meal, and finished it at a later time.

Pardon my bewilderment, but I'm 22 and I absolutely can't wrap my head around this.  I've been on a major depressive episode for at least a week and this is more than I do in an entire day.  I got out of bed at 4pm EST and I am eating Waffle Crisp, and patting myself on the back for it.

Does anyone want to have a discussion to help make this seem more attainable and real?  I posted this on the mental health sub because it is a universal requirement for any health problem to have proper diet and exercise.

The odd thing is that I was an elite track runner in HS and some of college.  I am very up to date on amino acid profiles of various foods, I have the anti-inflammatory diet basically memorized after being raised on it, and my household was so over-controlled that I never developed intuition for cooking, even after 2 years of food service.

Would anyone like to share a ""babby's first survival while living alone"" guide?  I'm fairly sure my word count on this sub is overwhelmingly giving advice over requesting it, so I hope this is an appropriate topic.  Thank you for reading.

Maybe not the right place to post, but you guys have given some great advice before

anyways I've always been stuck when it comes to improving my confidence or myself. then I payed some attention to my thoughts, and noticed they tend to go towards thinking about the way I behaved in the past.

And I realized I feel like I can't improve because of my past.

My past is full of me acting like a pussy and a bitch, I mean like badly. you know those cringepics people sometimes post on reddit, yeah those basically describe me, a beta. I was harassed when I was in grade school, and I have never really had much self esteem. I've done so many things that just show how I'm a bitch, and I've done things which were selfish and which hurt people and which I feel bad about. I've done pathetic shit like constantly texting people hoping they would help me out in life, or always trying to take the easy route, or being to afraid or lazy to approach people, or laying in bed feeling sorry for myself, or giving up at the slightest hint of resistance, or never confronting people who were hurting me, or always running away from my fears

with all the acting like a bitch ive done in my past, It doesn't seem possible for someone for me to go from where I'm at to becoming my ideal self, someone confident, physically fit, not a bitch. hell I doubt anyone can pull off or has pulled off such a feat.

all of this ends with the consequence of me being at where I am today: overweight, low self esteem, low self confidence, feeling depressed, never acomplisghed or done anything significant in my 23 years of life, never had a girlfriend, lost friends because of how big of a bitch I am, little to no self discipline, i feel inferior to others (especially people who have major acomplishments or who are physically fit, i can barely even talk to such people i feel so inferior and nervous) and I don't like where I am.

HOW can anyone like me even dream of or think of becoming better?! Its just seems impossible, it doesn't seem within reality to accomplish. It seems like the damage is done and there's no going back, there is no way I can become like all the confident and good looking and successful people out there who have never acted like as big of a bitch as I have. I feel like there is nothing I can do to redeem myself from acting like a bitch like I've done

so what can I do, if there even is anything I can do? I guess I'm also kinda looking to be proven wrong, to know that someone has gone from being a little bitch to an alpha male, and what I can do to become that.

Also, it seems just posting this and getting it out there makes me feel a little better. Any advice is really appreciated, this is something that has been bogging me down for a while now

Doesnt seem possible for me to redeem myself and become an alpha male",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"I feel like its impossible for me to get better. with how ive acted in the past, I feel im beyond redemtion for becoming better"

I decide to came here because i think i have a mental problem.

The background first:

Two months ago my girlfriends leave me, i really care about her but i try to shutdown any sad or negative feeling because i have many responsabilitys on me.

in the last month and half i have surfer a lot pressure on me. 

I was ending a very difficult semester because in my country was a student strike that paralyzed the college for several months so for me as many students of  my university we have to do all the work of 12 weeks only in 8 weeks after the strike.

So in 8 weeks i have to defy like 9 exams, 14 practices and 3 big projects.    And i have to add i am the kind of person that works alone, i dont have a study group.

I work  part-time like programmer, in generally i can manage all my task in my job because the boss is never in the office.  Is always travelling making business with the software my patners and me make.   But the boss decided to stay the last month here in the office and he is fanatic of see people working a lot of hours in the office.     So always was pressure of he on me to immediately after class go to the office and work until late at night.   Even once he call me when i was in the middle of  a exam to ask me if i was on the way  to the office.

In general when my boss is no here i took part of work projects and finished in my house during the weekends but my boss hate that because he thinks we can steal his source code of  his  software products.   So for that I couldnt keep my schedule as i wanted in the work or the university.

My mother got very sicks so she was hospitalized for a week, so in the night i have to take care of her in the hospital and later she have to stay in bed for another week and half and also i  have to take care of her.

And by taking care i mean: prepared and gave food, be aware of the medicines, help her clean herself.

I have a younger sister that is not very helpful at home and i have many fights with her because her boyfriend, bad friendships (and  I meand bad),   in generally she is a mess and i try to she leave that mess.

For all the thing i said before  i have to sleep like only 5 hour each days,  i have to quit the gym, Stop to reading (i love reading) anything that wasnt from my university subjects, i have to eat a lot of junk food. 

I surfer during this period anger, depression, stomach problems, sometimes i cried for nothing.



The consecuences.

The hardship period  ended  2 weeks ago and in this time i have surfer many strange problems.

In some moments i start to cry without reason.



I try to pay the phone bill from my bank account but only did a transfer to the bank account of a friend and also I was forgetting that  already the phone bill was paid by me.

I try to be writer (in spanish my original language) so I open a word document and start to typing and typing.   30 minutes later i went to the bathroom and when i come back to my laptop to continue writting  i saw the word document was empty.  There is not any letter so where was everthing i was typing?     well,   everthing i wrote was in my facebook wall, facebook chat and my twitter.

About writting,  when started to write i forget to add words like example: ""i want to  live more"" this phrase is like that in my mind but in the word document appears ""want live more"".   I am forgetting words when i am typing. 


I went to the grocery store and i try to pay with my license driver when i my mind i have the idea I took my debit card from my wallet.

One day i go out to the birthday party of a friend, the problem when i took the taxi  was the i said the Street address  of another friend that live in the oposite part of the city.   My birthday friend lives in the north and i went to the south thinking i was going to party.

At the party of my friend whe started to play poker and  I confused the  ""Q""  and ""K"" cards, in my mind both cards where the same. 

It happen  like three time when i want to call my mother i ended calling  one of my friends but unconsciously.   

I love to read but now i am reading but no reading, I Trying to read the chapter one of a novel i cannot continue  because i cant remember anything of the chapter one.

And making more badly the last thing,  i watch a movie and after the end of the movie i cannot say what was about, is like everthing i saw the hour and half before never was store in my brain.


I surfer two times so far  sleep paralysis. 

Also i wake up  the past days with the need of the feeling i have to do something.  Is like kind of anxiety of need to do something.

Also  i am lacking of energy, like almost sleepy during the day. In few words my watchful or awake state is at minimum level.

I am surfer of eating disorder i need the feel to eat something every moment.   I general I controled this feeling but one day i eat so much that I vomit.
  
One day my right hand was shakeing or trembling a lot without control.

Yesterday i put  my cellphone in my bed but later i coulnt remember where i put it and spend like two hour looking my cellphone.

And those were my problemas so far.

Somebody can give me a advice, what i have?   i should go to the doctor ask for help??

For the past 2 and half years or so I have been very lonely and have felt like I didn't have any actual friends, I just have no idea how to connect with someone or how to be close to someone or what that even means. I had friends I hung out with but it felt like I could only hang out with them when I was capable of putting on a happy or fun presence, and I purposefully kept my private and personal life and struggles to myself. I was so afraid of them knowing about any kind of struggle I had and me bringing pain into their life and them seeing what kind of person I really was and no longer wanting to be friends with me. Over the summer I actually became close to a friend I had known for a long time, she had a lot of problems with anxiety and I helped her a lot and I started to feel I might actually have a close friend. It was really hard but eventually I started to tell her my true feelings if I was not feeling well. One night after hanging out with friends made me really anxious I broke down and cried told her all of my feelings and, ever since it happened I've been in a constant state of shame. All I can think about is how she has seen that part of me and how much she probably hates me and that she doesn't want to be my friend anymore. I wish I had been able to keep my thoughts to myself. I feel like I'm in a constant state of fear and shame and that I need to be alone forever to stop this from happening again. I'm terrified to talk to her or see her knowing she knows about who I really am. I can't stop crying and want to hide from everyone I know for the rest of my life. I don't know what to do to make these anxieties go away or how to talk to a friend ever again. I had to go to the movies with her and another friend and thought I was going to throw up the entire time, I was so afraid of being there, especially with her knowing. I can't bring myself to talk to her, I can only assume if she doesn't talk to me herself she doesn't want to talk to me at all. She probably never wants to talk to me again, but I can't blame her. I just feel so horrible and I wish I didn't have to be myself, I just wish I could be a normal person and have friends and stop being so lonely.

I've never been to a therapist because my mom doesn't believe in taking meds. See we have a history of schizophrenia in our family and both my mom's brother and sister are pretty messed up on their meds. 

So there's that. 

But anyway, ever since I was young, I would suddenly become overwhelmed by a feeling of awareness (?). For example, I'll just be sitting in a room with people and suddenly feel very aware and embarrassed about nothing, but not exactly embarrassed. It is as if there is an elephant in the room and everyone knows about it and I know about it and I almost want to laugh but then I realize that they don't know about it and then I suddenly feel very awkward and uncomfortable. 

I also find that when I am alone, I sometimes talk to no one, but as if I am speaking directly to a therapist or someone who is listening to my problems. I speak very casually and freely and feel better, despite there being no one actually listening. I also feel incredibly anxious all of the time and i can't focus because there is this sort of… pressure… that fills my head (it's the best way to describe it). It's like a cluster of emotions and thoughts and worries and anxieties that suddenly swarms my brain (normally whenever I become idle), and it makes me extremely uncomfortable and at times very upset. I begin to feel as if I am having an existential crisis of sorts, and I find myself conflicted: Is there a point to my crazy brain? Or am I just weak and unable to control my emotions and my thoughts? I sort of have an internal battle with myself in my own head. It's as if on the one hand, I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but on the other hand, it's how I am and I should just learn to deal with it.

I function well socially, but I am insecure and always worried about what people think. I often find myself immediately thinking of others in any given situation, which often leads me to make decisions that I wouldn't have chosen otherwise, which makes me upset because in hindsight I wish that I had just gone with what I wanted. I have a job, but at work I let my coworkers boss me around because if they even question something that I am doing, I immediately feel as if I must be doing it wrong (even when I'm not). I have some pretty severe mood swings, and I find myself daydreaming about hypothetical situations that make me upset or angry at people that I care about and I don't know why I do that. 

I find it hard to trust people because I believe that people act in order to satisfy their own wants and needs. This makes it so that when someone acts a certain way, I try and figure out what it is they are trying to satisfy in themselves, rather than just watching them act and moving on with my life. 

I have been dating a girl for almost three years now and we are very invested in each other, but I find it hard to trust her sometimes (very irrationally) and spent a decent amount of time during our early relationship being hyper jealous of how she acted around people socially because I always felt as if she was flirting with other guys. I'm over it now and we are stronger than ever, but sometimes I still feel randomly and irrationally jealous. 

Because of all of my over thought, anxiety, mood swings, depression, insecurity, etc, I find it hard to keep my hold on what's really happening around me socially. When I begin to feel randomly jealous, for example, I have an internal battle (self-awareness vs my irrationality) and can't ever really decide what the truth is. 


But yea, I'm not quite sure what any of you will make of this. I just needed to vent.

Over the past year, I've become more and more aware that I have quite serious trust issues. Without going into details (as I'm not sure I can describe this properly), my up-bringing was weird, a combination of really large scale bullying at school, and emotionally distant parenting left me in a place I didn't really understand at the time.

Looking back, I realise I've never trusted anyone in my life, people are all a potential threat, I've never developed an emotional connection to anyone, barring when I was a toddler and had an intuate connection to my parents (which is now long gone).

My experiences left me cold to other people, and I've had deeply traumatic experiences in basic conversation with people at work, where I've just melted down in the middle of basic plesent conversation. These little episodes were confusing and frightening in their own right, especially when I didn't understand them. I'm now coming 'round to the idea that I have an almost phobia-like reaction to other human beings. The problem is I still have emotional needs, and have suffered pretty badly over the years with sporratic depression and anxiety attacks, but I'm too bare-faced scared to deal with it.

Googling ""trust issues"" gives me pages and pages of advice on ""Regaining trust after a bad break-up"" sort of things(never been in a relationship in my life :/) as such this isn't much help.
 
It just seems to be like ""cronic/life-long trust issues"" isn't a thing. Having given up on google, I want to know, what do you guys think about long term trust problems?

I try to do everything for my wife that I can. I am really feeling hurt, but every time I bring it up I feel I am being attacked. She says do you not love me. I am suffering and I can't take it, but my guilt has stopped me from doing anything. Basically my wife fell in love with another person and basically told me we are opening up our marriage. I agreed because I want her to be happy. So she has a really shitty relationship that fucked our whole world up. So I am feeling lonely and started to reach out to people online. Just to feel an emotional connection. I informed her, because I am always honest and I can't lie to her. She flipped out and said I don't love her all while having her own relationship. She said it was my fault for not caring enough and not giving her enough attention. I work, but not excessively. I try to give her all my attention during my waking hours. Slowly I becoming detached and I don't feel good about anything. My medication duolextine is not helping any more with the depression where it was.

I didn't even feel that jealous that she had a partner on the side I just wanted her to be happy if that is what she needed. I feel like I give my everything and sacrifice for her and all I get told is I don't love her so I try harder and it is not good enough... I have tried multiple times to get us into couple's counseling and she says we don't need it and it is a huge fight whenever it happens.

The codependence thing came from a friend. I also have a history of substance abuse in my family as well as mental illness....

I am falling apart. I brought up that I was going to get therapy and my wife freaked the fuck out. I told her I need help and she just told my why would you spring this on me it wasn't fair and I must not love her...

I need help. Do I need to separate from her in the short term? I know I need some help I am burning out. I feel immense guilt even bringing up my problems as I don't want to hurt her or burden her...

I am going to get fired if I don't get my act together I have an awesome laid back tech job that I love but I have lost my ability to work well and I am really good at what I do so I can get by for a while but I am going to a dark place where things don't matter. I have cut off most of my family ties because it takes time away from my wife.
Please provide me some validation or advice?

Updated I reached out to my dad for help he has been through his share of shit and probably caused a lot of mine, but he is who I have right now. He is healthy and clean and sober for years and is supportive.

Updated: I confronted my wife and told her it was over and she has to go stay with her parents. She promised to change and she could not leave me and she could help me, but kept insisting I didn't love her. Her mood has changed temporarily to lovey and supportive. I think it is an attempt to control me. Idk. See reply about control below there is more I am realizing about how unhealthy this is that I blocked out as acceptable behavior.

Good news: we have agreed to individual and couples therapy. So that is the plan. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I feel I may be co-dependent and being emotional abused by the person I love most my wife.

Several suicide attempts wasn't seen as important to my parents. So it wasn't until now that I'm a legal adult that I got any help. But there's more going on now. I should mention who I am though. I am a 19 year old girl. I've lived a rather normal life other than a few things. My patents where physically and mentally abusive. Mostly my dad, he'd hit us with his belt hard enough that i still have scars up and down my back. The boy (only like 10 or 12 when it started) molested me on a fairly regular basis from when I was 6 till I was 8 and it only stopped because I moved. Last year getting in a car accident started me having some pretty bad anxiety problems. I say all this in case any of it is relevant.
I started hearing voices. At first it was like a group of people all whispering. I couldn't understand what they where saying. It sounded like it came from the outside world. I had a hard time telling if it was real for a while. Then recently I started hearing once that came from inside my head. I could understand them clearly.  They say such terable things to me! They really hate me. They hate me so much. Sometimes they tell me to do things. I don't do anything they tell me to do to other people. Everyone keeps telling me ""Don't listen to them!"" but do you have any idea how hard it is to ignore someone who is in your own freaking mind?!?! I only just started doing some of the things that they want me to. They call me a slut, a bitch, crazy, stupid, worthless, freak. 
I've only told a few people. My therapist said it sounds like bad depression (though honestly at this time I don't feel all that depressed) and he told me to talk to my doctor. My doctor thinks it might be schizophrenia and wants me to talk to a psychologist. My father and younger sister don't believe me. They think I'm making it up.  My mother seems to think I'm bipolar but shes thought that for years. My older sister will probably believe whatever the professionals say. I've also told two friends. They think what my doctor said because as I was describing it one of them basically finished my story with what he's read about schizophrenia. I want to know what you lovely people think since I just found this sub. I have an appointment with the psychologist in September. I'd really love it if they could shut these stupid voices up. They are driving me crazy!!

If someone even as great as Robin Williams, who brought happiness and laughter to so many, can succumb to the debilitating effects of depression, why does it seem that society still holds this stigma towards mental illnesses?

I personally had an unimaginably difficult time reaching out for help, and I still do, because most people I know treat mental diseases almost as some sort of joke. It almost seems to be the ""hip thing"" with kids these days to say they are ""depressed"" or ""bipolar"" when they're still going out enjoying life and living normally with friends and family. 

I'm not saying that they aren't suffering similar or worse issues than I am, or that we can't function normally once in awhile, but so many teenagers seem to say these things with a wide grin slapped on their faces like they're almost proud of their disorders while I'm over here struggling everyday trying not to be lazy and push these suicidal thoughts from my head. 

Then when I finally try and reach out for help, people just say, ""it's a phase we all go through, you'll get over it,"" or ""well, you're not as depressed as I am!"" as if it's some sort of competition to see who can suffer the most.

“I don’t want to live in a world where Robin Williams commits suicide.”

That’s a quote from Reddit user filmfiend999. At first glance, it’s quite fitting. But I think there’s more to it.

Most of my life consists of me lost in my own head, wondering about the many things I cannot control. These things have the ability to take over a mind and tear you up inside.

Nihilism is a strange concept to many – unbelievable to many, too. But there are times it makes sense. Perfect sense. How can a child, so innocent and pure, have cancer ravage its tiny body? How can an entire nation starve when just an ocean away we binge eat on pizza and cheeseburgers? How can a man, so humble and giving, so spectacularly funny and talented, be in so much pain? The hardest part for any of us is simply picturing him so very sad that this was the answer. What a horrid image.

“There’s a plan for everything.”

No there’s not. A plan is an attempted execution of events, sequenced to accomplish a final task or goal. A plan makes sense in context and works towards the completion of something in accordance. A plan (not a sane one, at least) is not an amalgamation of things, packed together by large hands creating a meatball of shit, in order to accomplish the ultimate goal. Which is what, in this case? The self-imposed death of a genius?

There is no plan. There is no ultimate goal, aside from what is the direct result. You eat, you get full. You cut yourself, you bleed. You live, you die. Things happen because they do, because that’s life. And life is not a test. Life is not a prerequisite. Robin Williams didn’t kill himself because nature decided to make him an example for the many lives he might have saved yesterday, to be anointed a saint (or, conversely, to burn in hell). That was simply the result, not the reason. The reason was because the human brain isn’t perfect. For all the marvel and all the wonder, it’s still broken in the vast majority of people – myself included. It just so happens that all some people need are an oil change or a tune-up, where someone like Robin Williams or Phillip Seymour Hoffman or Kurt Cobain or the kid my wife went to high school with were irrevocably damaged – head on collisions with a force to strong they couldn’t help but drive into it.

It’s easy to take from that the misery and disgust many have. It’s easy to take a look at it and think, well, there is no real purpose. But that, in itself, might just be the real purpose. You live life to live life. And while I find myself, a person with two children and a pretty goddamn good life, asking what the purpose is quite often, I come up with this answer most of the time.

We all live the same life. We’re born, we try our best to survive (and most of us to survive with the same purpose – just because the ideals are different doesn’t mean the intentions are) and we die. Everything in between is luck of the draw, and what we do with it is of our own accord. Robin Williams, as tormented and demonized as he seemed to be, took his talent and humility and made the world a slightly better place for many, and a much better place for some. But he did. And when you can still live life accordingly, with love and generosity, knowing that at the end of the day everything you touch with be gone, leaving only those who remember your stories to be your advocates, you’re a special person. Maybe that’s what separates someone from the rest.

So while I don’t want to live in a world where Robin Williams kills himself, I do want to live in a world where Robin Williams lived.

“When in doubt, go for the dick joke.” – Robin Williams.

www.justinmermelstein.com/when-in-doubt-go-for-the-dick-joke",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,My thoughts on Robin.
[deleted],,,1407864532,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2dcp4i/robin_williams_death_has_hit_me_hard_and_then_it/,2dcp4i,True,0,False,1441223120,1,"For several years now, the American population has seen a rapid rise in violence as connected with mental illness. Not just violence against others, but violence against oneself and the tragic suicide of Robin Williams is just the latest in this long line of terrifying and heartbreaking events. In the last many years we have paid so much attention to the vile acts of violence against others that have been committed by individuals that happen to suffer from mental illnesses like asperger's syndrome, antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, etc. (ie Adam Lanza, James Holmes, Elliot Rodger, just to name a few). This drives the conversation into a very narrow space where mental illness is violent and angry and dangerous. The mentally ill are perceived as threats to the public and shouldn't be trusted - shouldn't be afforded the same rights as ""normals"" and deserve extra scrutiny in nearly everything that they do.

Problem is, mental illness is a far greater danger to the ones who live with it than those that live around it. I have lived with bipolar disorder since I was 14, though only have been correctly diagnosed as such within the past year. I am 31 years old. I have actively attempted to take my own life three times in the last fifteen years, nearly succeeding the last time; passively I have endangered my life more times than I can count by merely engaging in reckless behavior that has left me vulnerable. The idea of hurting someone else, however, doesn't just not appeal to me but it makes me genuinely sick to my stomach. I am not a danger to society. Most that live with mental illness of any kind, aren't.

Robin Williams in his diagnosis was far from alone, especially in Hollywood. Other incredibly celebrated artists, musicians, directors, actors, etc., live lives of similar duality - great humor, life and character in public; privately in a tormented state of flux. Stephen Fry addressed many of these people in his documentary, ""The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive"", in which people like Carrie Fisher and Richard Dreyfuss expose themselves as (what 'normals' may call) unstable. The one thing none of them are, are dangerous to anyone but themselves. These are creative and intellectual geniuses - high IQ's, great understanding of comedic success, and an ability to empathize and tap into emotion that can touch us all. Mental illness often can create the most caring and compassionate of attitudes in people, and yet this nation, this culture, has been all too quick to categorize the mentally ill (as of late, especially) as a threat to the national stability. I, however, beg to differ.

When someone of prominence dies, the nation inevitably spend time rallying together, to fight the common cause of what would have brought down such cultural or political titans. When Philip Seymour Hoffman passed, the conversation focused on fighting heroine and addiction and seemed to put his bipolar disorder on the back burner - it was a side note and irrelevant to his overdose. With Robin Williams, his life (according to big media) was a series of very sad times split up between periods of addiction and the fact that he, too, lived with bipolar, hasn't really been the headline - and these gentlemen aren't alone in having become fatal victims to their own mental illnesses. Heath Ledger, Brittany Murphy, (likely) Cory Monteith, Amy Winehouse, Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, Jonathon Brandis, Hunter S. Thompson...the list can go on and on.

It is as though admitting the people we love, respect, admire and idolize have mental illnesses would somehow diminish the quality or the power of their work. For me, as someone who can understand living with a personality disorder, it makes it all so much more powerful. It makes them as successful artists in the limelight being held to great expectations, public criticism, demanding schedules, high stress situations, all the more inspiring even in the wake of tragic events like overdoses and suicide.

So what do we take from all of this, this time around? It seems irresponsible to me to continue walking around with our heads in the sand, convinced that celebrities don't really suffer from mental illness - it's always the drugs and the booze that broke the camel's back, it would seem big media would like for you to believe - and the people that do suffer from it are nobodies that are inevitably going to threaten the lives of the average American in one way or another. We attack mental illness as though it is a defect in the poorest-of-character among us. Mental illness has become a point of shame that should be kept hidden from view, as though it were under the control of those that live with it, and in doing so it makes it near impossible for celebrities to be truly honest about the severity of their conditions, their need and frequency for treatment and that it's not a defect, but rather a facet of personality that can be a positive, albeit complicated, driving force in one's life if we allow it.

Enough is enough with vilifying those of us that live with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anti-social personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, anorexia, bulimia, body dysmorphic disorder, autism spectrum disorder and every other developmental disability and mental illness that exist.

None of us are the same as the others. We are not a collective danger. We are not a collective threat. We are humans who were born as we are. We do not choose our paranoia and insecurity. We do not choose our self-loathing or our grandiose self image. We do not choose to be different from anyone else, we just are. We can live with that. It's time for everyone else to learn to do the same.

Robin, you were an inspiration to me and millions of others that struggle to live the good, positive, healthy life every day despite whatever obstacles we experience, internal or external. ",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"Robin Williams death has hit me hard, and then it made me think about how we talk a lot and pretty accurately, about mental health when the person is a bad guy, but we never do it as well or accurately when it's someone we all love.

About two years ago my wife I noticed a change in my wife's behavior.  She started thinking that people were coming in our house and taking her stuff.  She stopped talking to her friends and started suspecting that it was them that was causing the issue.  She also thought that people were tracking us, taking our 2nd car whenever we left somewhere and using our car for drug runs.  There are many other explanations she uses to explain why and how people are coming in our house and why they are using her things.  No amount of reasoning resolves the issue, it just becomes a circular argument.  Anything out of place or dirty in our house becomes suspicious.  Of course this is complicated by the fact that we have young children.  Despite that fact, she suspects an external source of out of place things rather than the obvious source.

She is only suspicious of things when the house is left empty.  If someone is in the house she does not become suspicious.  The first thing she does when we come home if we have both left the house is look for something to be out of place and of course she finds something.  This belief makes it really hard for her to want to leave the house, or inconveniences me to have to stay at home if she is going out.

It's a complete psychosis for her, she posts her ""findings"" on facebook, and I worry that it just makes her look strange to everyone else.

Otherwise 95% of the time she is a high functioning individual and has no problems taking care of herself, the kids, running errands, etc.

I am not sure how to help her as she does not recognize that her perceptions are not real and as such does not want to go to talk to a therapist.  I think I might need to talk to a therapist to figure out how to deal with the situation without upsetting her, but we do not live in a metropolitan area and mental health resources where we live are pretty non existent.

I have tried even making an appointment in the nearest town with resources (about 50 miles away), but I have received the run around of not accepting my insurance, referral to another therapist, that therapist doesn't return my call, etc which in the end results in it being easier to just ignore the issue and try to deal with it the best I can.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,"wife thinks that people are coming in the house, using and taking her stuff"

There are lots of people for whom depression is not temporary, though. I'm wondering what their thoughts are on that quote. If I had something like bipolar II or chronic pain, I think I would be offended by it. To me, it implies that all you need to do is ""tough it out"".

There was few arguments when I was young, my parents gave me and my sister a happy and peaceful home. They never abused us, never raised a hand to us or were verbally negative. But because I had a great home life that didn’t mean I was okay. I’m not sure when it started but for as long as I can remember I have always felt that there was something wrong with the world. That there was something missing that I couldn’t quite grasp onto. Because of this I was always thoughtful. Before I spoke I contemplated and decided when my input was needed and when it wasn’t and because of that I was quiet.
 As I got older this feeling that the world wasn’t right turned into I wasn’t right. My contemplating twisted from this is a valid point to why even talk at all, everything you say is worthless. After a while I stopped talking at all and when I did it was reserved and never what was on my mind. As time when on my thought’s got worse. I was either left with a feeling of numbness or pain. I was always confused about how those around me could be so confident, how they could laugh so freely and be who they were so easily while I struggled. 
Every second of the day I struggled to fight off my negative thoughts, the worthlessness and burden I felt. I never have and still don’t feel comfortable showing someone everything there is about me. I’m not fake, not in the slightest but I have always shown different people different sides of me. The parts of me that my mind convinces me are wrong and freakish and hide away, ashamed that those things are a part of me. It’s stupid because they are small things, things like how I enjoy to write or watch anime. But because I love these things so much I feel that there must be something wrong with liking these things. 
Eventually I needed an outlet for this pain. I turned to self-harm. My arms are scared, my thighs the worst and at one point I even contemplated cutting worthless or freak into my skin so I never forgot what I was. Without self-harm I felt numb. I felt cold, emotionless and alone. I know it’s stupid but that knife in a way I considered my friend because it was the only thing I felt helped me. Eventually I began to think of suicide. To me there is a difference between wanting to die and thinking people will be better off without me. Because if I’m honest I didn’t want to die. I just didn’t want to burden anyone anymore, I didn’t want anyone thinking they had to be nice to the freak anymore.
I tried about five times. The first times pills and the other four I cut down the full length of my arm but it was never deep enough. In these moments though my mind was clear. The negative thoughts had stopped and everything seemed to make sense. I wasn’t thinking about me, or the pain stopping. I was thinking that if I was gone everyone else would be ok. That they would be relinquished of the burden that I felt I was. At those moments suicide was the right thing. It was not selfish…it was an act of selflessness. 
Looking back now I know those thoughts were wrong. That my mind had twisted due to an illness that left me in such darkness that I was desperate for it to end. Suicide is an act of desperation. It is easy for people to say if only they knew I cared they wouldn’t have done it. In that moment, that moment of complete and utter hopelessness it is like you are in a soundproof dome. You see the people who care for you, banging on the glass, screaming at you not to do it but you can’t hear them. Your mind twists it. You see them staring, judging and accusing. You see the disappointment and the fear and your mind takes that and turns it into they are better off without you. 
Now I know that fear was them scared of losing me. The staring was them watching me for signs so they could reach out and save me. I struggled for years, fighting my descent into that well that depression is. It’s a long way down and it is a long way up. You claw at the walls, trying and many times failing to get out and at times you feel like you won’t so you sit and you wait at the bottom with only your negative thoughts to keep you company and then it stops. And when it stops that is the moment when you become happy because you think you have found the way to stop it. 
That moment of clarity and happiness, that is the moment where people should be most afraid because that is the moment when the depression has won. I no longer feel this way. I won the battle over my depression with the help of my family. I don’t know why I wrote this, I guess it’s because a lot of people say I’ve been there but it’s never described how you got there. I guess I just wanted people to see that it’s a process and one you don’t realise you are on until you’re so far down it seems impossible to get back up. I guess I just want people to know that when you are at your darkest moments that is when you find a strength to stand back up and fight. Because that’s what mental illness is. It is a battle and one that can be won.

It is quite long, but I truly believe all of this to be true about depression. I hope you can take the time to read it.

_______

Depression is not an illness or disease, it is not some permanent affliction or offset of brain chemicals that must be numbed by a chain of medications. Depression is a state of being. Depression is also a state of change. Depression is confliction or inconsistencies present in a person's belief system, a state of perplexion about the world and who they are. Depressed people hold a lack of acceptance towards themselves and the universe around them, someone stuck in the past and future, stuck in a state of immense insatiability, leading to feelings of despair and hopelessness, sometimes leading to suicide.

However, I do not think depression is something to be stigmatized. In fact I think depression is beneficial, positive and largely misunderstood. Depression is a state of being like I said, I think it is a natural process seen primarily in sensitive humans, but sensitive humans also develop at the fastest rate. Depression once worked through can be seen as analogous to our concept of a positive developmental result. Depression when naturally worked through instigates an inevitable positive restructure of your current belief systems and a reinforcement of newly created or improved belief systems towards the world and self, creating a wiser and stronger individual. 

The result of depression is often immense positive change brought on by immense negative feelings. Sensitive people feel things the deepest and reflect the deepest, so in the same sense they go through depression harder and develop faster because of it.

Please see Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration if you would like more information regarding sensitive people, depression and their heightened development created through their deeper despair, which eventually tapers out completely. People who are depressed, truly depressed, also are likely to have access to the highest and most abundant feelings of contentment once they work through their depressions.

My biggest fear that is currently at play is the use of medication to null this developmental effect of depression. People are scared of depression, so it is stigmatized. We need to understand as a collective that the negative results of depression can lead to immense positive change for the individual, and through cause and effect, the world. The most significant intellectuals and humanistic figures throughout history were sensitive people, and I can assure you they all suffered from one of or a combination of anxiety disorders or intense phases of depression.

In that light, are we dulling human progression by mindlessly prescribing people with ""depression"" powerful medications that halt those vital phases of development? Burrowing that negative reflection for another day because we think it will lead to suicide? It may lead to suicide, but that is of a natural result. The human race is not perfect. However, often medication gets people stuck in these phases of insatiability for their whole lives, dulling the pain and their ability to reflect and feel the depression properly, in order to work through it towards positive change.

When the medications (or chain of them) inevitably run out of practical use, that's when suicide is the most prevalent. It's entirely ironic, paradoxical. But we are killing depressed people by giving them these medications, and close-necking them from ever developing into something greater, because they often have that potential. we just do not collectively understand this.

Depression is not an illness, it is a state of being and negative development that can lead towards immense positive change for the individual when medication is absent, as medication stops these processes from naturally running their course.

The use of medication for depression and anxiety is primitive, we need to start paying attention and getting people who suffer from these ""disorders"", ""diseases"", ""illnesses"" access to psychotherapists and resources that will instigate a natural progression through their depression(s). The effect a lot of these sensitive people could have on the world is extremely substantial.

This isn't just about making people feel better, this about allowing the human race to thrive fully, and right now we are unknowingly oppressed by a cultural misconception of negative feelings powered by an uneducated media along with manipulative pharmaceutical companies.

Negative feelings are not bad, they are necessary for change. The result of positive collective change, brought on through a global acceptance of negative insight being present within the human race, far outweighs the result of trying to ""FIX"" the momentary feelings of an individual's depression in progress. There is absolutely nothing to fix, depression is a natural and vital process of human evolution and is essential for human growth individually and collectively, right now we are slowing it down.

Depression is an affinity towards wisdom, anxiety is an affinity towards imagination. These are interrelated. Is it not wrong to say that the most influential people of the world were both imaginative and wise?

Even people who suffer from depression mildly, people who are less sensitive, still have so much to gain and give to the world from positively moving through their depression naturally and not with the ""aid"" of chemicals, which only halts that progression.

We must stop bottle-necking new, significant change for the human race by medicating the part of the population that should inevitably and naturally go through phases of depression and anxiety, as these are facets of their unique development and role within our race.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,A Unique Perspective of Depression.
